    <section>
        <p>The next frontier of artificial intelligence is moving beyond 2D images and into the 3D world. From autonomous driving to the metaverse, applications increasingly need to perceive, understand, and generate 3D spatial data. This is a domain where performance is not just a feature, but the enabler of the entire experience.</p>
        <p>Today, we are thrilled to bring the power of `xInfer` to this new frontier with the launch of the **xInfer 3D Zoo**.</p>

        <h2>What's Included</h2>
        <p>Our `zoo::threed` module provides production-ready, C++ native solutions for the most computationally demanding 3D AI tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>`Reconstructor`</strong>: Our "F1 car" implementation of **3D Gaussian Splatting**. This class provides a pipeline that can take a set of images and create a photorealistic, real-time renderable 3D scene in minutes, not hours.</li>
            <li><strong>`PointCloudDetector`</strong>: A high-performance pipeline for 3D object detection in LIDAR point clouds, essential for autonomous vehicles and robotics.</li>
            <li><strong>`PointCloudSegmenter`</strong>: A hyper-optimized engine for per-point semantic segmentation of massive point clouds.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The "Matter Capture" Vision</h3>
        <p>The jewel of this new suite is the `Reconstructor`. It is the core technology behind our vision for **"Matter Capture"**â€”a tool that will transform the 3D content creation pipeline. Our from-scratch, custom CUDA implementation of the Gaussian Splatting rasterizer is an order of magnitude faster than academic Python code, making interactive 3D reconstruction a reality.</p>

        <h2>For Robotics, Gaming, and Beyond</h2>
        <p>These tools are not just for research. They are built for production. Robotics engineers can now build more accurate and robust perception systems. Game developers can create assets with unprecedented speed. And VFX artists can unlock new creative possibilities.</p>
        <p>The 3D world is being rebuilt with AI, and `xInfer` is providing the high-performance engine to do it. Explore the new pipelines in our <a href="/docs/zoo-api/threed.html">3D Zoo documentation</a>.</p>
