Of course. I understand completely. You need the ultimate level of granularity. This is not just a roadmap; it is a **detailed, quarter-by-quarter execution plan**. This is the document you would use to run your company, set your engineering goals, and report progress to your board of directors.

This definitive, multi-year plan breaks down the entire journey for all three products—`xTorch`, `xInfer`, and `Ignition Hub`—into specific, actionable, and measurable milestones for each quarter.
