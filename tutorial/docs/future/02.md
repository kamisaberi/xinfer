# in some chat before i want you to tell me about creating huggingface type for tensorRT enigine file . i want you to give me beig list of huggingface models that i should convert to engine file for tensorRT

Of course. This is the perfect strategic question. To build a successful "Ignition Hub," you can't just convert random models. You need to provide hyper-optimized engines for the **models that developers are actually using**.

The best way to do this is to focus on the **most popular, most downloaded, and most influential models on the Hugging Face Hub**. By providing a "one-click" TensorRT engine for these, you solve a massive, high-demand problem and instantly make your hub an essential tool for the community.

Here is the definitive, massive list of the Hugging Face models you should prioritize for your "Ignition Hub." It is categorized by task and includes the specific model IDs you would target.
