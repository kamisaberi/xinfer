Of course. This is the roadmap for your core commercial engine and your deepest technical moat. The `xInfer` roadmap must be focused on a relentless pursuit of performance, usability, and expanding its capabilities to solve the hardest deployment problems.

Here is the definitive, detailed, and comprehensive milestone plan for `xInfer`, from its inception as a set of expert tools to its maturity as a universal performance layer for AI.

---

### **`xInfer`: A Detailed Product & Technology Roadmap (v0.0 to v2.0)**

**Core Mission:** To be the definitive C++ toolkit for deploying AI models at maximum speed and efficiency by automating TensorRT optimization and eliminating CPU bottlenecks with custom CUDA kernels.

---

### **Phase 1: The Foundation (Version 0.0 -> 1.0) - ACHIEVED**

**Objective:** To build a toolkit that is demonstrably and significantly faster than any other C++ inference solution, and to wrap its power in a simple, accessible API.

| Version | Milestone | **Key Features & Technical Achievements** | **Strategic Purpose** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v0.1** | **Internal Alpha: "The Runtime Core"** | - **`core::Tensor`:** A robust, RAII-compliant C++ wrapper for GPU memory. <br> - **`core::InferenceEngine`:** A minimal-overhead class that can successfully load a pre-built TensorRT engine and run synchronous inference. <br> - **Initial `xinfer-cli`:** A basic command-line tool for running a benchmark on an existing engine file. | Validate the core runtime architecture. Prove that a clean C++ wrapper around the TensorRT runtime can be both safe and fast. |
| **v0.3** | **Internal Beta: "The Factory & The Kernels"**| - **`builders::EngineBuilder`:** The first version of the fluent C++ API for building engines. It successfully converts an ONNX file to a basic FP32 TensorRT engine. <br> - **`preproc::ImageProcessor`:** The first and most important "F1 car" kernel. A fused CUDA kernel for the `Resize -> HWC-to-CHW -> Normalize` pipeline, proving the performance thesis. <br> - **`postproc::detection::nms`:** A custom CUDA kernel for Non-Maximum Suppression. | **Build the Technical Moat.** This is the phase where the core IP—the custom CUDA kernels and the builder automation—is created. This proves the "10x faster" value proposition is real. |
| **v0.5** | **Public Beta: "The `zoo` Emerges"** | - **First `zoo` Classes:** `zoo::vision::Classifier` and `zoo::vision::Detector` are implemented. They provide the first "easy button" experience by orchestrating the `preproc`, `core`, and `postproc` modules. <br> - **`xinfer-cli` gets a `build` command:** The CLI tool can now be used to build FP32 and FP16 engines from ONNX files. <br> - **First Public Release:** Published on GitHub with documentation for the first `zoo` classes. | **Deliver the "Magic."** The `zoo` is the primary user-facing product. This release is the first time a developer can experience the magic of getting a hyper-performant pipeline running in just a few lines of C++. |
| **v0.8** | **Release Candidate: "Enterprise Ready"** | - **INT8 Quantization Support:** The `builders::EngineBuilder` and `xinfer-cli` now support full INT8 quantization. <br> - **`builders::INT8Calibrator`:** A crucial piece of the puzzle, including the `DataLoaderCalibrator` that integrates seamlessly with `xTorch`. <br> - **`builders::onnx_exporter`:** A robust utility for converting trained `xTorch` models into the ONNX format. | **Unlock Maximum Performance & Complete the Workflow.** INT8 is the key to the ultimate performance-per-watt, a critical feature for enterprise and edge customers. The `onnx_exporter` creates the final link in the seamless `xTorch` -> `xInfer` pipeline. |
| **v1.0** | **Stable Release: "A Complete Ecosystem"** | - **Comprehensive `zoo`:** The `zoo` is expanded to cover over 100 tasks across multiple domains (Vision, NLP, Generative, etc.), as we have detailed. <br> - **`hub::downloader` API:** The `InferenceEngine` and `zoo` classes are now "hub-aware," with constructors that can download pre-built engines from the Ignition Hub. <br> - **API Stability & Full Documentation:** All public APIs are stable. The documentation site is complete and professional. | **Establish Market Leadership.** The v1.0 release is a massive statement. It positions `xInfer` not just as a tool, but as a comprehensive, mature, and indispensable platform for any serious C++ AI developer. |

---

### **Phase 2: Expansion & Dominance (Version 1.0 -> 2.0) - THE FUTURE ROADMAP**

**Objective:** To evolve `xInfer` from the best tool for NVIDIA GPUs into the universal, hardware-agnostic performance layer for all of AI deployment.

| Version | Milestone | **Key Features & Technical Achievements** | **Strategic Purpose** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v1.2** | **"The 'F1 Car' Factory"** | - **"Fusion Forge" Initiative (Internal R&D):** Formalize the R&D team dedicated to novel architectures. <br> - **First Custom Kernel Release:** Release the hyper-optimized, from-scratch **Mamba** kernel and integrate it into the `builders` as a premium optimization option. <br> - **New `zoo` Modules:** Launch the `zoo::special::genomics` module, built around the new Mamba engine. | **Deepen the Technical Moat.** This is a massive strategic move. You are no longer just *using* TensorRT; you are now building custom, high-performance kernels that are **provably better** than the standard. This establishes you as a world-class R&D organization. |
| **v1.5** | **"The Universal Performance Layer"** | - **Pluggable Backend Architecture:** Refactor the `core::InferenceEngine` to support multiple backend providers, not just TensorRT. <br> - **Experimental AMD ROCm Support:** Implement the first alternative backend using AMD's **ROCm/MIGraphX**. A selection of `zoo` classes (e.g., `Classifier`) can now run on AMD GPUs. <br> - **`xinfer-cli` Expansion:** The CLI tool gets new flags: `--backend tensorrt` and `--backend rocm`. | **De-risk the business and massively expand the TAM.** By breaking the dependency on a single hardware vendor (NVIDIA), you become a more attractive and stable partner for large enterprises. You are now competing to be the performance layer for the *entire* AI hardware market. |
| **v1.8** | **"The Full Pipeline Abstraction"** | - **New `xinfer::pipeline` Module:** Create a new, high-level API that allows users to define a full, multi-stage pipeline in code (e.g., `preproc -> model1 -> model2 -> postproc`) and have `xInfer` automatically compile it into a single, optimized graph. <br> - **Automatic Kernel Fusion:** The pipeline builder will be able to automatically fuse a user's custom `postproc` logic directly into the TensorRT graph as a plugin. | **Move Up the Stack.** You are moving from providing pre-built pipelines (`zoo`) to providing the tools for users to build their own custom, fused pipelines with the same "F1 car" performance. This is an incredibly powerful feature for advanced users. |
| **v2.0** | **Mature Platform: "The AI Compiler"** | - **Stable Multi-Backend Support:** The AMD ROCm backend is now production-ready. Experimental support for another backend (e.g., Intel OpenVINO, ARM Compute Library) is introduced. <br> - **"Fusion Forge" Expansion:** The R&D team has released 2-3 additional custom kernels for the latest, most important AI architectures. <br> - **Full Integration with `Ignition Hub 2.0`:** The `xInfer` build tools are now just a client for the powerful, cloud-native build and fine-tuning services of the Hub. The local build process is now an optional, advanced feature. | **Achieve the Grand Vision.** `xInfer` 2.0 is no longer just a TensorRT toolkit; it is a true, hardware-agnostic **AI compiler and runtime**. It is the single, unified C++ API for achieving maximum performance on any hardware backend. It has become the definitive, indispensable performance layer for the entire professional AI industry. |
