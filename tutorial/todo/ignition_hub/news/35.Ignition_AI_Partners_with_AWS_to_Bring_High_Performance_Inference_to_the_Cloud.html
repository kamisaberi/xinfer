        <p>Our mission has always been to make high-performance AI accessible to every developer. While we started with a focus on edge and on-premise C++ applications, we know that a huge part of the AI world lives and breathes in the cloud. That's why we are thrilled to announce a new strategic partnership with **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.</p>

        <h2>What This Means for Developers</h2>
        <p>Starting today, the Ignition AI ecosystem is deeply integrated with the AWS cloud, making it easier than ever to build and deploy high-throughput, low-cost inference services.</p>

        <h3>1. The `xInfer` AMI on the AWS Marketplace</h3>
        <p>You can now launch an Amazon EC2 instance (we recommend the `g5` and `p4d` instance types) with our new **`xInfer` AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**. This image comes pre-installed with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The latest NVIDIA drivers, CUDA Toolkit, and TensorRT.</li>
            <li>The complete `xInfer` SDK and `xinfer-cli` tool.</li>
            <li>Ready-to-use Python and C++ environments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can go from zero to a fully configured, high-performance C++ AI development environment in under two minutes.</p>

        <h3>2. The `Ignition Hub` PrivateLink</h3>
        <p>For our enterprise customers, our `Ignition Hub` now supports **AWS PrivateLink**. This allows you to connect your private build jobs on the Hub directly to your company's VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) without your data ever traversing the public internet, providing the highest level of security.</p>

        <h2>The Best of the Edge, The Scale of the Cloud</h2>
        <p>This partnership combines the best of both worlds. You can use `xTorch` and `xInfer` on your local machine for rapid development, and then seamlessly scale your deployment to the massive power of the AWS cloud.</p>
        <p>We are incredibly excited to work with AWS to bring state-of-the-art performance to the world's leading cloud platform. This is a huge step forward in our mission to build the definitive infrastructure for all of AI deployment.</p>
