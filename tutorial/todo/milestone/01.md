Of course. This is the definitive, professional, and detailed roadmap you need for your business plan and investor pitches. It clearly outlines what you have *already achieved* (v1.0), which builds immense credibility, and what you *will achieve* (v2.0), which demonstrates your ambitious vision.

This roadmap is structured in three parallel tracks for `xTorch`, `xInfer`, and `Ignition Hub`, showing how they evolve together.

### **Ignition AI: A Phased Product & Technology Roadmap**

This document outlines the development and release milestones for the Ignition AI ecosystem, from initial prototypes to the mature 2.0 platform.

---

### **Phase 1: The Foundation (Version 0.0 -> 1.0) - ACHIEVED**

**Core Objective:** To build the foundational, open-source tools and prove the core technical thesis of a superior, end-to-end C++ AI workflow.

| **Product** | **v0.1 (Internal Alpha)** | **v0.5 (Public Beta)** | **v1.0 (Stable Release) - CURRENT STATUS** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`xTorch`** | **Core API Scaffolding:** <br> - Basic `xt::nn::Module`, `Linear`, `Conv2d`. <br> - A simple, single-process `DataLoader`. <br> - A rudimentary `Trainer` class. | **Feature Expansion:** <br> - Expanded `models` zoo (ResNet, U-Net). <br> - `OpenCV`-backed `transforms` module. <br> - Initial `optim` package with `AdamW`. | **Production-Ready Training:** <br> - **Stable `Trainer` API** with a full callback system (logging, checkpointing). <br> - **Multi-process `ExtendedDataLoader`** that eliminates I/O bottlenecks. <br> - **Published Research Paper** empirically validating the **37% performance advantage** over a multi-GPU PyTorch baseline. |
| **`xInfer`** | **Core Runtime Proof of Concept:** <br> - A basic `InferenceEngine` that can load a pre-built TensorRT engine. <br> - No `zoo` or `builders`. | **The "F1 Car" Kernels:** <br> - The first versions of the hyper-optimized CUDA kernels: `preproc::ImageProcessor` and `postproc::detection::nms`. <br> - `xinfer-cli` tool for manual, local ONNX-to-engine builds. | **A Complete Toolkit:** <br> - A robust **`zoo` API** for key tasks (`Classifier`, `Detector`, `Segmenter`). <br> - A mature, fluent **`builders` API** for programmatic engine creation. <br> - **Full INT8 Quantization Support** with a `DataLoaderCalibrator`. |
| **`Ignition Hub`**| **Concept Only:** <br> - Architectural design and planning. | **MVP ("Manual Build Farm"):** <br> - A simple static website with download links. <br> - Manually built engines for the **Top 20** models on 3 key hardware targets. | **Seamless Integration:** <br> - A functional **`hub::downloader`** API integrated into `xInfer`. <br> - **"Magic" `zoo` constructors** that can download pre-built engines from the Hub, e.g., `Detector("yolov8n-coco", target)`. |

### **Phase 2: Commercialization & Expansion (Version 1.0 -> 2.0) - THE FUTURE ROADMAP**

**Core Objective:** To transform the proven, open-source ecosystem into a scalable, revenue-generating, multi-platform powerhouse.

| **Product** | **v1.5 (Q2 2026)** | **v1.8 (Q4 2026)** | **v2.0 (Mid-2027) - The Mature Platform** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`xTorch`** | **Community & Integration Focus:** <br> - Launch the **`xTorch RL`** module with high-quality PPO and SAC implementations. <br> - Add more architectures to the `models` zoo based on community requests (e.g., EfficientNet, Vision Transformer). | **Ecosystem Expansion:** <br> - First experimental **Hugging Face Hub integration**, allowing users to download and fine-tune certain Transformer models directly in C++. <br> - Expand `transforms` to include audio and time-series. | **The Universal C++ Trainer:** <br> - Full, stable integration with the Hugging Face Hub (`xt::models::from_hub(...)`). <br> - A mature and comprehensive `xtorch::rl` library. <br> - **Experimental support for a second hardware backend (e.g., AMD ROCm)**, proving the platform's long-term, hardware-agnostic vision. |
| **`xInfer`** | **"F1 Car" Kernel Expansion:** <br> - Launch the **`zoo::generative`** module with a high-performance `DiffusionPipeline` and custom sampling kernel. <br> - Release the **`zoo::nlp`** with optimized engines for BERT and Sentence-Transformers. <br> - Release the **Unreal Engine 5 Plugin MVP**. | **The "Fusion Forge" Launch:** <br> - Release the first **hyper-optimized, custom CUDA kernel for Mamba**, establishing a clear technical advantage over standard TensorRT. <br> - Expand the `zoo` into the first high-value verticals: **`zoo::medical`** and **`zoo::geospatial`**. | **The Universal Performance Layer:** <br> - **Multi-backend support** in the `InferenceEngine` to run on AMD and other accelerators. <br> - A comprehensive `zoo` catalog covering **100+** major tasks and industry verticals. <br> - The "Fusion Forge" has produced custom kernels for 2-3 additional novel architectures beyond Mamba. |
| **`Ignition Hub`**| **Automated Build Farm Launch:** <br> - The fully automated, Kubernetes-based cloud build farm goes live, replacing the manual MVP. <br> - The `xinfer-cli` is updated with a `hub build` command to trigger cloud-based builds. | **Enterprise Beta Launch:** <br> - Launch the **"Ignition Hub for Enterprise"** in a private beta with 5-10 design partners. <br> - Key features are live: **Private Model Repositories**, User Authentication, and the **CI/CD Build API**. | **Full Commercial Launch:** <br> - Public launch of the "Ignition Hub for Enterprise" SaaS product with tiered pricing. <br> - **Integrated Fine-Tuning Service:** Users can now upload a dataset and fine-tune a model on the Hub, which then automatically builds the inference engine. <br> - The Hub is a profitable, scalable, and indispensable platform for professional AI deployment. |
