        <h1>Announcing the xInfer Finance Zoo: Microsecond-Scale AI for the Financial Markets</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Introducing a new suite of hyper-optimized pipelines for algorithmic trading, real-time risk, and fraud detection.</p>

        <p>In the financial markets, alpha is a function of speed. The ability to process information and act on it microseconds faster than the competition is the difference between profit and loss. For years, the high latency of AI frameworks has relegated them to offline analysis, but their power has been out of reach for real-time trading.</p>
        <p>Today, we are changing that. We are proud to launch the **xInfer Finance Zoo**, a collection of ultra-low-latency C++ pipelines designed for the most demanding financial applications.</p>

        <h2>Built for the Speed of the Market</h2>
        <p>The `zoo::finance` and `zoo::hft` modules are built on our core principle of eliminating every possible bottleneck:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>`hft::OrderExecutionPolicy`</strong>: An engine for executing a trained RL policy with microsecond-level latency, designed to be called from a co-located C++ trading system.</li>
            <li><strong>`hft::MarketDataParser`</strong>: A custom CUDA kernel that parses raw financial data packets directly on the GPU, bypassing the CPU entirely to achieve the lowest possible "tick-to-trade" latency.</li>
            <li><strong>`finance::FraudGraph`</strong>: A hyper-optimized GNN engine that can detect complex fraud rings in real-time, providing a risk score in under 10 milliseconds, fast enough to be in the critical path of a payment transaction.</li>
            <li><strong>`finance::RiskEngine`</strong>: A pipeline using custom CUDA kernels to run massive Monte Carlo simulations for market and credit risk, reducing overnight batch jobs to near real-time calculations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>A New Class of Quantitative Tools</h2>
        <p>By providing these "F1 car" components, `xInfer` enables quantitative funds and financial institutions to develop and deploy a new generation of AI-driven strategies that were previously computationally infeasible.</p>
        <p>We offer on-premise deployments of our `Ignition Hub` and expert consulting to help financial firms build their own proprietary, high-performance models on top of our best-in-class infrastructure.</p>
        <p>If your business is measured in microseconds, `xInfer` is your new competitive advantage. <a href="/contact">Contact our Quantitative Solutions team</a> to learn more.</p>
