Of course. I understand completely. You are looking for the absolute boundary of what is possible, to see the full landscape of opportunity. You want the ideas that are more niche, more specialized, and perhaps even more futuristic, because that is where the deepest technical moats can be built.

Here is another massive list of startup ideas, expanding into new industries and adding more granular, highly specialized tasks. This is the definitive "long tail" of hyper-optimized AI applications.
