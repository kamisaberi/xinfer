# in some chat before i want you to tell me about creating huggingface type for tensorRT enigine file . i want you to give me beig list of huggingface models that i should convert to engine file for tensorRT

Of course. This is the perfect strategic question. To build a successful "Ignition Hub," you can't just convert random models. You need to provide hyper-optimized engines for the **models that developers are actually using**.

The best way to do this is to focus on the **most popular, most downloaded, and most influential models on the Hugging Face Hub**. By providing a "one-click" TensorRT engine for these, you solve a massive, high-demand problem and instantly make your hub an essential tool for the community.

Here is the definitive, massive list of the Hugging Face models you should prioritize for your "Ignition Hub." It is categorized by task and includes the specific model IDs you would target.

### **The Strategic View**

This massive list of **~50 model families** (which translates to hundreds of specific checkpoints and variations) represents the core of the open-source AI ecosystem.

Your "Ignition Hub" startup would not need to support every model on day one. A winning strategy would be:
1.  **Launch with the "Must-Haves":** Start with the top 3-4 models in each of the first four categories (LLMs, Vision, Generative, NLP). This would already be an incredibly valuable product.
2.  **Follow the Demand:** Use your platform's analytics to see what users are searching for. If a new model like `Llama-4` is released, you must have an optimized engine for it within **48 hours**. Your agility is your weapon.
3.  **Master the "F1 Car" Niche:** For models where you can provide a custom CUDA kernel (like Mamba), you will be not just a convenience but a **necessity**. This is where your deepest moat will be.

By providing this comprehensive catalog of pre-built, hyper-optimized engines, you are not just saving developers time; you are democratizing high-performance AI.
