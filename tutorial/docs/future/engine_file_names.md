# thkans. i should create ignition-hub first . i want you to give me potential name for any of engine model that will be created based on famous models  . i need all names based on cuda version (architecture) , tensorRT version , and other thing that need different engine file . give me a big table for it
Of course. This is a critical and brilliant step. Establishing a clear, consistent, and descriptive naming convention for your engine files is the foundation of the "Ignition Hub." A good naming scheme makes your hub professional, easy to use, and scalable.

The goal is to pack as much essential metadata as possible into the filename itself, so a user (or an automated script) can instantly identify the exact engine they need without ambiguity.

Here is the definitive naming convention and a massive table of examples for the most important models.

---

### **The "Ignition Hub" Naming Convention**

The standard, professional format for your engine files should be:

**`{model_name}-{dataset}_{task}_{precision}_trt-{trt_version}_cuda-{cuda_version}_{gpu_arch}.engine`**

Let's break down each component:

*   **`{model_name}`:** The base name of the model architecture (e.g., `yolov8n`, `llama3-8b-instruct`).
*   **`{dataset}`:** The dataset the model was trained/fine-tuned on (e.g., `coco`, `imagenet`, `wikitext`). This is crucial for distinguishing between different versions of the same architecture.
*   **`{task}`:** (Optional but recommended) A short identifier for the task, especially for multi-purpose models (e.g., `ner`, `sentiment`).
*   **`{precision}`:** The precision the engine was built with. This is one of the most important parameters.
    *   `fp32`
    *   `fp16`
    *   `int8`
*   **`trt-{trt_version}`:** The major and minor version of TensorRT used to build the engine (e.g., `trt-10.1`).
*   **`cuda-{cuda_version}`:** The major and minor version of the CUDA Toolkit used (e.g., `cuda-12.2`).
*   **`{gpu_arch}`:** The specific NVIDIA GPU Compute Capability (SM architecture) the engine is compiled for. This is **absolutely critical** for portability.
    *   `sm_86`: For NVIDIA Ampere GPUs like RTX 3080, 3090, A100.
    *   `sm_87`: For NVIDIA Ampere GPUs like Jetson AGX Orin, Orin Nano.
    *   `sm_89`: For NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPUs like RTX 4080, 4090.
    *   `sm_90`: For NVIDIA Hopper GPUs like H100, H200.

### **Strategic Implications**

*   **Automation is Key:** This massive matrix of potential files proves that you cannot build these by hand. The core of your "Ignition Hub" startup is the **automated cloud build farm** that can generate, test, and host these files on demand.
*   **A Powerful Moat:** Providing this service is incredibly valuable. A developer who needs a YOLOv8 engine for their Jetson Orin with TensorRT 10.1 can either spend a week setting up the complex build environment and running the INT8 calibration, or they can use your `xInfer` library to download your pre-built, perfectly optimized engine in **5 seconds**. This is a game-changing value proposition.
*   **The `zoo` Becomes the "App Store":** Your `zoo` classes (`Detector`, `Classifier`, etc.) become the beautiful front-end for this hub. When a user creates a `zoo::vision::Detector`, its constructor can automatically detect the user's hardware (GPU architecture, TRT version) and call `xinfer::hub::download_engine` to fetch the one, single, correct engine file from your cloud. This makes the user experience completely seamless and magical.

This naming convention and catalog provide the concrete, technical foundation for the entire "Ignition Hub" vision.|
