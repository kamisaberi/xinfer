    <section>
        <p>Six months ago, we launched the Ignition AI ecosystem with a simple mission: to build the definitive platform for high-performance C++ AI. The community response to <code>xTorch</code> and <code>xInfer</code> has been incredible, and today we want to share the next major step in our journey.</p>

        <p>We've listened to the feedback from the many professional teams using our tools, and one request has been universal: they need a secure, scalable, and managed solution for their proprietary models. That's why we are building the <strong>Ignition Hub for Enterprise</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Your Private, Hyper-Performant Build Farm</h2>
        <p>Ignition Hub for Enterprise will be our first commercial SaaS product. It takes the power of our automated build farm and provides it to you as a secure, private service. It will feature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Private Model Hosting:</strong> Upload your proprietary, fine-tuned ONNX or <code>xTorch</code> models to a secure, single-tenant environment. Your IP never leaves your control.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Build Pipelines:</strong> Integrate our build service directly into your company's CI/CD pipelines via a REST API. Go from a `git push` to a deployed, optimized TensorRT engine in minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Guaranteed Support & SLAs:</strong> Get mission-critical, enterprise-grade support from our team of expert CUDA and TensorRT engineers.</li>
        </ul>
