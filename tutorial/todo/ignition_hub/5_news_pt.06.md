        <section>
            <p>You've seen the 2x speedup from FP16. But for many applications, especially on power-constrained edge devices like the NVIDIA Jetson, that's not enough. To achieve the absolute maximum performance-per-watt, you need to leverage the GPU's specialized INT8 Tensor Cores. This is **INT8 quantization**, and it can provide another **2x or greater speedup** on top of an already-optimized model.</p>
            <p>However, this power comes with a challenge: converting a 32-bit float model to 8-bit integers can cause a loss of accuracy if not done carefully. This guide will walk you through the "Post-Training Quantization" (PTQ) workflow and show you how `xInfer` makes this advanced technique safe and accessible.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Key: Calibration</h2>
            <p>The core of the process is **calibration**. To minimize accuracy loss, TensorRT needs to analyze the distribution of your model's activation values. You provide a small, representative sample of your data (a "calibration dataset"), and TensorRT runs the model, observes the value ranges, and calculates the optimal scaling factors to map the floating-point numbers to the `[-128, 127]` integer range.</p>
            
            <h3>The `xInfer` Workflow</h3>
            <p>`xInfer` simplifies this into a clean, three-step C++ process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a dataloader for your calibration images using `xTorch`.</li>
                <li>Wrap it in our `xinfer::builders::DataLoaderCalibrator`.</li>
                <li>Pass the calibrator to the `xinfer::builders::EngineBuilder`.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Example: Building an INT8 YOLOv8 Engine</h2>
            <p>Let's build an INT8 engine for a YOLOv8 model. This is the perfect use case for a latency-critical robotics or drone application.</p>
            
            <pre><code>#include &lt;xinfer/builders/engine_builder.h&gt;
#include &lt;xinfer/builders/calibrator.h&gt;
#include &lt;xtorch/xtorch.h&gt; // For the dataloader
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;

int main() {
    try {
        // Step 1: Create a dataloader for your calibration dataset.
        // This should be a small (e.g., 500 images) but representative sample.
        auto calib_dataset = xt::datasets::ImageFolder("/path/to/coco/calibration_images/");
        xt::dataloaders::ExtendedDataLoader calib_loader(calib_dataset, 16);

        // Step 2: Instantiate the xInfer calibrator.
        auto calibrator = std::make_shared&lt;xinfer::builders::DataLoaderCalibrator&gt;(calib_loader);

        // Step 3: Configure and run the EngineBuilder with INT8 enabled.
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Building INT8 engine... This will take several minutes.\n";
        xinfer::builders::EngineBuilder builder;

        builder.from_onnx("yolov8n.onnx")
               .with_int8(calibrator) // This is the key line!
               .with_max_batch_size(16);

        builder.build_and_save("yolov8n_int8.engine");
        
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "INT8 engine built successfully!\n";

    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; "Error building INT8 engine: " &lt;&lt; e.what() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>By using the `DataLoaderCalibrator`, `xInfer` completely automates the process of feeding batches of data to the TensorRT builder. The result is a hyper-performant INT8 engine, created with just a few extra lines of C++ code.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>INT8 quantization is the ultimate optimization for deployment, and it's a core competency of the `xInfer` toolkit. By making this powerful technique accessible, we enable developers to build AI applications that are smaller, faster, and more efficient than ever before, unlocking a new wave of possibilities on the edge.</p>

            <p>Today, we are proud to introduce the **xInfer Medical Zoo**, a new suite of professional-grade, high-performance C++ pipelines designed to bridge this gap and accelerate the future of AI-powered diagnostics.</p>
            <p><em>(Note: The `xInfer Medical Zoo` is for research and development use only and is not a certified medical device.)</em></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Pipelines for Critical Tasks</h2>
            <p>Our initial release provides robust, easy-to-use solutions for some of the most computationally demanding tasks in medical imaging:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>`zoo::medical::TumorDetector`</strong>: A pipeline for 3D tumor detection in CT and MRI scans, powered by a TensorRT-optimized 3D U-Net.</li>
                <li><strong>`zoo::medical::CellSegmenter`</strong>: A high-throughput tool for instance segmentation of cells in microscope images, enabling rapid analysis for research and pathology.</li>
                <li><strong>`zoo::medical::UltrasoundGuide`</strong>: An ultra-low-latency segmentation pipeline designed for real-time guidance during ultrasound-guided procedures.</li>

        <section>
            <p>Every business runs on documents—invoices, contracts, reports, and forms. Extracting structured information from these unstructured files is a massive and expensive manual process. While OCR can read the text, it doesn't understand the context or layout.</p>
            <p>To solve this, we are excited to launch the **xInfer Document AI Zoo**, a collection of powerful C++ pipelines designed to automate the most complex document processing tasks at scale.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>From Image to Structured Data</h2>
            <p>Our new `zoo::document` module provides end-to-end solutions that understand both the text and the visual structure of a page:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>`LayoutParser`</strong>: Uses a TensorRT-optimized instance segmentation model (like LayoutLMv3) to segment a document into its constituent parts: paragraphs, tables, figures, and headers.</li>
                <li><strong>`TableExtractor`</strong>: A powerful, two-stage pipeline that first identifies the structure of a table (rows, columns) and then uses our `OCR` engine to extract the text from each cell into a machine-readable format.</li>
                <li><strong>`SignatureDetector`</strong>: A specialized object detector for finding handwritten signatures in legal or financial documents.</li>
                <li><strong>`HandwritingRecognizer`</strong>: A specialized OCR pipeline fine-tuned for transcribing handwritten text.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The `xInfer` Advantage: High-Throughput Processing</h3>
            <p>A bank or an insurance company may need to process millions of documents per day. A Python-based, cloud-service solution can be slow and incredibly expensive at this scale. The `xInfer` Document AI Zoo is designed for high-throughput, on-premise deployment. Our C++ pipelines can process documents at a rate that is an order of magnitude faster and cheaper than the competition.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>The Future of Enterprise Automation</h2>
            <p>By providing these fundamental building blocks for document understanding, we are enabling our enterprise customers to build powerful automation workflows, from automated invoice processing to intelligent contract analysis.

        <section>
            <p>In the world of high-frequency trading, the only currency that matters is time. The competitive edge is measured in microseconds and nanoseconds. For years, the latency of AI models has made them a non-starter for the most speed-critical trading strategies. Any tool that introduces Python-level overhead is a non-starter.</p>
            <p>At Ignition AI, we are obsessed with performance. We believe that AI can provide a true "alpha" advantage, but only if it can run at the speed of the market. That's why we built the **xInfer HFT Zoo**.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Built for the Critical Path</h2>
            <p>The `zoo::hft` module is not a general-purpose library. It is a collection of hardened, "zero-overhead" C++ components designed to be integrated directly into a co-located, real-time trading system. Our initial release includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>`OrderExecutionPolicy`</strong>: An ultra-low-latency engine for running a trained RL policy. It takes the market state as a GPU tensor and returns a decision in single-digit microseconds.</li>
                <li><strong>`MarketDataParser`</strong>: A custom CUDA kernel that can parse raw financial data packets (like FIX/FAST) directly on the GPU, bypassing the CPU entirely. This is designed for use with kernel-bypass networking cards to achieve the lowest possible data-to-decision latency.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The `xInfer` Advantage: Deterministic Performance</h3>
            <p>Beyond raw speed, our HFT solutions are designed for **low jitter**. The C++ architecture and pre-compiled TensorRT engines ensure that your inference latency is not just low, but also highly predictable and deterministic, which is critical for systematic trading strategies.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>A Partner for Quants</h2>
            <p>We understand the secretive and demanding nature of the quantitative finance industry.
