### **`xTorch`: A Detailed Product & Technology Roadmap (v0.0 to v2.0)**

**Core Mission:** To build the world's best C++ deep learning library for training and research by combining the productivity of PyTorch with the performance of native C++.

---

### **Phase 1: The Foundation (Version 0.0 -> 1.0) - ACHIEVED**

**Objective:** To build a stable, usable, and high-performance alternative to raw LibTorch that solves the most immediate pain points for C++ AI developers.

| Version | Milestone | **Key Features & Technical Achievements** | **Strategic Purpose** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v0.1** | **Internal Alpha: "Proof of Concept"** | - **Core `xt::nn::Module`:** A clean, RAII-compliant base class for defining models, removing LibTorch's boilerplate. <br> - **Basic Layers:** Implemented `Linear`, `Conv2d`, `ReLU`, `MaxPool2d`. <br> - **Rudimentary `Trainer`:** A single-threaded `for` loop wrapper for a basic training cycle. <br> - **Simple `Dataset` & `DataLoader`:** Single-process, able to load in-memory tensors. | Validate the core architectural idea: a high-level API on top of LibTorch is feasible and desirable. |
| **v0.3** | **Internal Beta: "Usability Sprint"** | - **`xt::models` Zoo:** Implemented the first standard architecture: `ResNet` (18, 34, 50). <br> - **`xt::optim` Package:** Added `Adam` and `SGD` with a clean, `torch::optim`-like interface. <br> - **Serialization:** Implemented the `xt::save()` and `xt::load()` functions for easy model checkpointing. <br> - **`xt::utils::summary()`:** Added the Keras-like model summary utility. | Focus on developer experience. Make the library feel like a cohesive, thoughtful tool, not just a collection of functions. |
| **v0.5** | **Public Beta: "Community Launch"** | - **`xt::data::transforms` Module:** A complete, chainable data augmentation API with an **OpenCV backend** (`Resize`, `CenterCrop`, `RandomHorizontalFlip`, `Normalize`). <br> - **`xt::data::datasets::ImageFolder`:** The crucial dataset class that allows users to work with their own image data easily. <br> - **First Public Release:** Published on GitHub with initial documentation and examples. | **Attract Early Adopters.** Provide the critical features needed for a user to train a real-world computer vision model on their own data, from start to finish. |
| **v0.8** | **Release Candidate: "Performance & Stability"**| - **`ExtendedDataLoader`:** The multi-process, pre-fetching data loader. This is a massive engineering effort that **solves the Python GIL bottleneck** and is a key performance differentiator. <br> - **`Trainer` with Callbacks:** The `Trainer` class is re-architected with a robust callback system, allowing for custom logging, checkpointing, and early stopping. <br> - **Benchmarking & Paper:** Conducted the rigorous performance comparison against PyTorch, leading to the published research paper. | **Solidify the Technical Moat.** The multi-process dataloader and the empirical proof from the benchmark paper establish `xTorch` as a technically superior, not just a more convenient, solution. |
| **v1.0** | **Stable Release: "Production Ready"** | - **API Stability:** All core APIs are now considered stable and come with a promise of backward compatibility. <br> - **Comprehensive Documentation:** A full documentation site (built with MkDocs) is launched. <br> - **Expanded `models` Zoo:** Added `U-Net`, `DCGAN`, and `LeNet5` to the model zoo. <br> - **Expanded `optim` Package:** Added `AdamW` and `ReduceLROnPlateau`. | **Build Trust & Credibility.** The v1.0 release signals to the world that `xTorch` is a mature, reliable, and professionally maintained library that is ready for serious use in both research and production prototyping. |

### **Phase 2: Expansion & Ecosystem Integration (Version 1.0 -> 2.0) - THE FUTURE ROADMAP**

**Objective:** To evolve `xTorch` from a powerful standalone library into the central, indispensable training hub for the entire C++ AI ecosystem.

| Version | Milestone | **Key Features & Technical Achievements** | **Strategic Purpose** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v1.2** | **"The RL Expansion"** | - **Launch `xtorch::rl` Module:** Release a new, major module for Reinforcement Learning. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A `gym`-like `xt::rl::Env` base class for creating C++ environments. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - High-quality, production-ready implementations of **PPO** and **SAC**. <br> - **New `models`:** Add common policy network architectures (e.g., `ActorCritic`) to the `models` zoo. | **Capture a New, High-Value Vertical.** The robotics and gaming industries are desperate for a high-performance, C++ native RL training solution. This module directly addresses their biggest pain point and brings a whole new category of developers into your ecosystem. |
| **v1.5** | **"The Great Integration"** | - **Hugging Face Hub Integration (Read-Only):** This is a massive feature. Implement `xt::models::from_hub("bert-base-uncased")`. This function will download the model configuration and weights from the Hugging Face Hub and automatically build the corresponding `xTorch` model in C++. <br> - **Expanded NLP Support:** Add core Transformer building blocks (`MultiHeadAttention`, `TransformerEncoderLayer`) to the `xt::nn` module to support this. | **Become the C++ Gateway to the World's Models.** This feature transforms `xTorch` from a library with a small, curated zoo into a tool that can access the entire universe of open-source AI models. It is an immense value proposition. |
| **v1.8** | **"The Multi-Platform Vision"** | - **Experimental AMD ROCm Backend:** Abstract the core compute calls. Build and test the library on AMD GPUs using the ROCm/HIP stack. This is a major architectural undertaking. <br> - **Enhanced Serialization:** Create a new, unified `.xt_model` artifact format that saves not just the weights, but also the model architecture config and the `transforms` pipeline parameters. | **De-risk the Future and Improve Usability.** Proving that `xTorch` is not just an "NVIDIA library" makes it a much more attractive long-term bet for large enterprises. The unified artifact is the final piece needed for the "magic" `xInfer::zoo::from_xtorch` workflow. |
| **v2.0** | **Mature Platform: "C++ AI, Unified"** | - **Full Hugging Face Integration:** The `from_hub` functionality is now stable and covers a wide range of architectures. <br> - **`Ignition Hub` Integration (Write):** Implement `trainer->publish_to_hub(...)`. This allows a user to seamlessly push a model trained in `xTorch` directly to their private `Ignition Hub` repository, completing the end-to-end workflow. <br> - **Stable Multi-Backend Support:** The AMD ROCm backend is now production-ready. The library is a true, hardware-agnostic C++ platform. | **Achieve the Grand Vision.** `xTorch` 2.0 is no longer just a training library; it is the central, indispensable **development and training platform** for all professional C++ AI. It has a massive community, a vast library of accessible models, and a seamless, "one-click" path to high-performance production deployment via `xInfer` and the `Ignition Hub`. |
