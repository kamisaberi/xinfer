# The `xInfer` Model Zoo API

Welcome to the `xInfer::zoo`. This is the high-level, "batteries-included" API for `xInfer`.

**The `zoo` is a collection of pre-packaged, hyper-optimized, and incredibly easy-to-use solutions for the world's most common AI tasks.**

### The Philosophy: Solutions, Not Just Tools

While the **[Core Toolkit](../core-api/index.md)** provides the powerful, low-level "engine parts" for building custom pipelines, the `zoo` provides the finished "F1 car."

Each class in the `zoo` is a complete, end-to-end pipeline that abstracts away all the complexity of pre-processing, inference, and post-processing. The goal is to let you solve a complex problem like real-time object detection or image generation with just **two lines of C++ code:**

1.  One line to **initialize** the pipeline from a pre-built engine.
2.  One line to **predict**.

This is the power of the `zoo`. It gives you the full, state-of-the-art performance of a custom C++/CUDA/TensorRT application with the simplicity of a high-level library.

### Key Features of All `zoo` Classes

- **Performance by Default:** Every `zoo` class is built on top of the hyper-performant `xInfer::core::InferenceEngine` and uses fused CUDA kernels from the `preproc` and `postproc` modules wherever possible.
- **Simple, Task-Oriented API:** You don't interact with raw tensors. You provide a `cv::Mat` image and get back a `std::vector<BoundingBox>` or a `std::string`. The API is designed around the final answer, not the intermediate steps.
- **Seamless Hub Integration:** Most `zoo` classes have special constructors that can download a pre-built, perfectly optimized engine for your hardware directly from the **[Ignition Hub](../hub/index.md)**. This provides a "zero-setup" user experience.
- **Robust and Production-Ready:** These classes are designed to be used directly in your final application. They are efficient, safe, and easy to integrate.
