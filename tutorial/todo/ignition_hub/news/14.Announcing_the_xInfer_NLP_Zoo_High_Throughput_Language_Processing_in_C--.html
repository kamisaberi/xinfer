        <p>At Ignition AI, our mission is to deliver the fastest possible performance for all AI workloads. While our initial focus has been on computer vision, we are thrilled to announce a major expansion of our platform: the **xInfer NLP Zoo**.</p>
        <p>C++ applications in finance, gaming, and server-side processing often need to handle a massive throughput of text data. The latency and overhead of calling a Python microservice for tasks like sentiment analysis or semantic search is a major bottleneck. The `xInfer NLP Zoo` solves this by bringing state-of-the-art Transformer models directly into your C++ application, running at maximum speed.</p>

        <h2>What's Included in the NLP Zoo v1.0</h2>
        <p>Our initial release provides easy-to-use, high-performance pipelines for the most critical NLP tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>`zoo::nlp::Classifier`</strong>: For high-throughput sentiment or intent classification.</li>
            <li><strong>`zoo::nlp::Embedder`</strong>: The backbone of semantic search and RAG. Generate sentence embeddings with state-of-the-art models like Sentence-BERT at incredible speed.</li>
            <li><strong>`zoo::nlp::NER`</strong>: For extracting named entities from text.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example: High-Performance Semantic Search</h3>
        <p>With the new `Embedder`, you can build a semantic search engine that is orders of magnitude faster than Python-based solutions.</p>
        <pre><code>#include &lt;xinfer/zoo/nlp/embedder.h&gt;

int main() {
    // 1. Initialize the embedder with a pre-built Sentence-BERT engine
    xinfer::zoo::nlp::EmbedderConfig config;
    config.engine_path = "all-mpnet-base-v2.engine";
    xinfer::zoo::nlp::Embedder embedder(config);

    // 2. Create embeddings for your document database (this is done once)
    std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; documents = {"doc1.txt", "doc2.txt", ...};
    auto document_embeddings = embedder.predict_batch(documents);

    // 3. At query time, embed the query and find the most similar document
    std::string query = "What is the capital of France?";
    auto query_embedding = embedder.predict(query);

    // ... (fast vector similarity search logic) ...
}
            </code></pre>
    </section>

        <h2>The Future is Multi-Modal</h2>
        <p>This is just the beginning. The NLP Zoo is a core part of our strategy to make `xInfer` the definitive performance platform for all AI domains. Stay tuned for our upcoming releases, which will include pipelines for summarization, question answering, and high-throughput LLM inference.</p>
