# a important question . if i have rtx3090 that is CUDA_ARCHITECTURE sm_86 , can i create engine file for sm_85 or below ?

That is an excellent and critically important question. The answer is fundamental to how you will design your "Ignition Hub" build farm.

The short answer is: **Yes, absolutely.**

A more powerful GPU can build a TensorRT engine for **its own architecture or any less powerful (older) architecture**. However, the reverse is not true.

Let's break this down.

### **The Principle: Forward Compatibility, Not Backward Compatibility**

The NVIDIA CUDA compiler (`nvcc`), which is what TensorRT uses under the hood, is designed with **forward compatibility** in mind.

*   **Your GPU (RTX 3090, `sm_86`):** This GPU has a specific set of hardware features, instruction sets, and capabilities defined by the "Ampere" architecture. It knows how to execute the machine code for `sm_86`. It *also* knows how to execute the simpler machine code for all previous generations (`sm_75`, `sm_70`, `sm_61`, etc.).

*   **An Older GPU (e.g., RTX 2080 Ti, `sm_75`):** This GPU only understands the "Turing" architecture. It does **not** have the hardware or the instruction set to understand the more advanced features of Ampere (`sm_86`).

Therefore:

| Your Build Machine GPU | Target `gpu_arch` | **Is this possible?** | **Why?** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RTX 3090 (`sm_86`)** | `sm_86` (itself) | ✅ **Yes (Best Performance)**| The engine is compiled to use all the native features of your GPU. |
| **RTX 3090 (`sm_86`)** | `sm_75` (Turing) | ✅ **Yes** | The compiler will intentionally "dumb down" the code, avoiding any Ampere-specific features and only using instructions that a Turing GPU can understand. |
| **RTX 3090 (`sm_86`)** | `sm_70` (Volta) | ✅ **Yes** | Same as above. The code is compiled for an older, less complex hardware target. |
| **RTX 3090 (`sm_86`)** | `sm_89` (Ada Lovelace) | ❌ **No** | The compiler does not know how to generate code for hardware that doesn't exist yet (from its perspective). It cannot create instructions for features your `sm_86` GPU doesn't have. |
| RTX 2080 Ti (`sm_75`)| `sm_86` (Ampere) | ❌ **No** | The `sm_75` GPU lacks the hardware capabilities to even run the TensorRT builder's optimization passes that are specific to the `sm_86` architecture. |

### **Strategic Implication for Your "Ignition Hub" Build Farm**

This principle is the cornerstone of your entire cloud build strategy. It means you do not need one of every single GPU in existence.

**Your build farm can be composed of only the most modern GPUs.**

A build farm with just a few key, modern servers can cover almost the entire market:

1.  **A Hopper Server (H100 - `sm_90`):** This single machine can build engines for `sm_90`, `sm_89`, `sm_87`, `sm_86`, `sm_75`, `sm_70`, etc. It can cover the entire high-end cloud and developer market.

2.  **An Ada Lovelace Server (RTX 4090 - `sm_89`):** This would be your workhorse for building engines for developers with modern consumer cards. It can build for `sm_89`, `sm_87`, `sm_86`, `sm_75`, etc.

3.  **A Jetson AGX Orin Dev Kit (`sm_87`):** While your Hopper server *can* build for `sm_87`, it is **best practice** to have a real embedded device in your farm. This is because embedded platforms have different power profiles and memory constraints, and building directly on the target hardware can sometimes yield a more optimized result. This server would be dedicated to building all your Jetson engines.

**Conclusion:**

Yes, your RTX 3090 (`sm_86`) is a powerful and flexible build machine. You can use it to build high-quality TensorRT engines for a huge range of target devices, including:
*   Other RTX 30-series GPUs (`sm_86`)
*   All Jetson Orin devices (`sm_87`)
*   All RTX 20-series and T4 GPUs (`sm_75`)
*   All V100 GPUs (`sm_70`)
*   And so on, for all older architectures.

This is a critical concept that makes the "Ignition Hub" economically and logistically feasible.
