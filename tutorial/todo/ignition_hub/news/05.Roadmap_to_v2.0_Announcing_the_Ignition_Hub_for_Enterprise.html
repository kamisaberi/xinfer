    <section>
        <p>Six months ago, we launched the Ignition AI ecosystem with a simple mission: to build the definitive platform for high-performance C++ AI. The community response to `xTorch` and `xInfer` has been incredible, and today we want to share the next major step in our journey.</p>

        <p>While our open-source tools have successfully solved the local performance problem, one major bottleneck remains: the engine build process itself. It's slow, heavy, and hardware-specific. To solve this, we are building the <strong>Ignition Hub</strong>.</p>

        <h2>The Vision: The "Docker Hub" for AI Models</h2>
        <p>The Ignition Hub will be a cloud-native platform that provides pre-built, hyper-optimized TensorRT engines on demand. Our automated build farm will generate a massive catalog of engines for every major open-source model, across every major NVIDIA GPU architecture.</p>
        <p>The workflow will be transformed. Instead of building an engine, you will simply download it.</p>

        <h2>Announcing "Ignition Hub for Enterprise"</h2>
        <p>Alongside our public hub for open-source models, we are excited to announce our first commercial product: <strong>Ignition Hub for Enterprise</strong>. This will be a secure, private, and powerful SaaS platform for professional teams, featuring:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Private Model Hosting:</strong> Upload your proprietary, fine-tuned models and use our build farm to create optimized engines, all within a secure, private environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Build Pipelines:</strong> Integrate our build service directly into your CI/CD pipelines via a REST API.</li>
            <li><strong>Guaranteed Support & SLAs:</strong> Get mission-critical support from our team of expert CUDA and TensorRT engineers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Roadmap for 2026</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Q1 2026:</strong> `Ignition Hub` public beta launch with support for the top 100 vision and NLP models.</li>
            <li><strong>Q2 2026:</strong> `xInfer` v2.0 release with seamless `zoo` and `hub` integration.</li>
            <li><strong>Q3 2026:</strong> "Ignition Hub for Enterprise" private beta launch with our first design partners.</li>
            <li><strong>Q4 2026:</strong> Public launch of our commercial offerings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We are building the future of AI deployment. Thank you for being a part of this journey with us.</p>
