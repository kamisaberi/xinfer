Of course. You are asking to expand the `zoo` into even more specialized, high-value vertical industries. This is the correct strategic direction for a library like `xInfer`, as it demonstrates its power to solve real, complex business problems, not just academic benchmarks.

Here is a big list of new, domain-specific `zoo` files, expanding into industries like Insurance, Legal, Construction, and more. Each one represents a complete, end-to-end solution built on your core `xInfer` technology.

### **New Category: `zoo/insurance`**

**Mission:** Automate the core, data-intensive workflows of the insurance industry: claims processing, underwriting, and fraud detection.

| Subject | New `zoo` Class / Filename | **What It Does (in one line)** | **Core "F1 car" Tech Inside** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Automated Claims Assessment** | `insurance/claim_assessor.h` | Takes images of vehicle damage and a repair invoice, and returns an estimated cost and fraud score. | A multi-modal pipeline combining `zoo::vision::InstanceSegmenter` (for damage), `zoo::document::OCR` (for invoice), and a final risk model. |
| **Property Risk Analysis** | `insurance/property_assessor.h` | Takes a satellite image of a property, and returns risk scores for fire, flood, and roof condition. | A pipeline using `zoo::geospatial::BuildingSegmenter` and specialized classifiers. |
| **Document Fraud Detection**| `insurance/document_analyzer.h`| Takes a submitted document (e.g., PDF claim form), and detects signs of digital alteration or forgery. | A specialized vision pipeline using error level analysis (ELA) models and font/metadata analysis. |

### **New Category: `zoo/legal`**

**Mission:** Provide tools that augment the capabilities of legal professionals, automating tedious, high-volume document review and analysis.

| Subject | New `zoo` Class / Filename | **What It Does (in one line)** | **Core "F1 car" Tech Inside** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Contract Analysis** | `legal/contract_analyzer.h` | Takes a long legal contract, extracts key clauses, and flags risky or non-standard language. | A long-context `zoo::nlp::NER` pipeline, likely powered by a Mamba or Transformer model. |
| **E-Discovery Triage** | `legal/ediscovery_classifier.h`| Takes a stream of documents, classifies them for relevance to a legal case (e.g., "privileged," "responsive"). | A high-throughput, batched version of `zoo::nlp::Classifier` optimized for document processing. |

### **New Category: `zoo/aec` (Architecture, Engineering & Construction)**

**Mission:** Bring high-performance AI to building design, site management, and safety.

| Subject | New `zoo` Class / Filename | **What It Does (in one line)** | **Core "F1 car" Tech Inside** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Blueprint Auditor** | `aec/blueprint_auditor.h` | Takes a blueprint image, detects components (doors, windows), and verifies compliance with building codes. | A pipeline combining `zoo::vision::Detector`, `zoo::vision::OCR`, and a C++ rules engine. |
| **Site Safety Monitor** | `aec/site_safety_monitor.h`| Takes a video feed from a construction site and generates alerts for unsafe conditions (e.g., missing PPE). | A multi-stage pipeline using `zoo::vision::Detector` for people/equipment and classifiers for PPE. |

### **New Category: `zoo/energy`**

**Mission:** Accelerate the analysis of massive geological and operational datasets in the energy sector.

| Subject | New `zoo` Class / Filename | **What It Does (in one line)** | **Core "F1 car" Tech Inside** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Seismic Interpreter** | `energy/seismic_interpreter.h`| Takes a 3D seismic data volume, returns a probability map of hydrocarbon deposits. | A TensorRT-optimized 3D U-Net or similar 3D CNN with custom pre-processing for SEG-Y data formats. |
| **Wind Turbine Inspector**| `energy/turbine_inspector.h` | Takes drone footage of a wind turbine, detects and localizes surface defects like cracks or erosion. | A high-resolution `zoo::vision::Segmenter` or `zoo::vision::Detector` pipeline. |
| **Well Log Analyzer** | `energy/well_log_analyzer.h` | Takes well log data (a multi-channel time-series), and predicts geological formations. | A `zoo::timeseries::Classifier` with a model trained for petrophysical data. |

### **New Category: `zoo/cybersecurity`**

**Mission:** Provide real-time, AI-powered threat detection at the network and endpoint level.

| Subject | New `zoo` Class / Filename | **What It Does (in one line)** | **Core "F1 car" Tech Inside** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Network Intrusion Detector**| `cyber/network_detector.h` | Takes raw network packet data, and classifies traffic as benign or malicious in real-time. | A custom GNN or Transformer model running in a low-level C++ application with direct network card access. |
| **Malware Classifier** | `cyber/malware_classifier.h` | Takes a binary executable file, and determines if it is malicious and what family it belongs to. | A specialized model that converts binary data into an image-like representation for a `zoo::vision::Classifier`. |
