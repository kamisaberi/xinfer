    <section>
        <p>At Ignition AI, we are obsessed with performance. While our initial focus has been on delivering the best possible experience on NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA and TensorRT, our long-term vision is to be a hardware-agnostic performance layer for the entire AI industry.</p>
        <p>Today, we are thrilled to announce the first step in that direction: **experimental support for AMD GPUs via the ROCm and HIP stack** in our `xTorch` training library.</p>

        <h2>The Path to a Multi-Vendor Future</h2>
        <p>The AI hardware landscape is becoming more diverse. As a company dedicated to our users, we know that you need tools that can run on the best available hardware, regardless of the vendor. Our engineering team has been working to abstract our core C++ architecture to support multiple backends.</p>

        <h3>What This Means for Developers (Today)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Experimental `xTorch` Training:</strong> Developers with AMD Instinct or Radeon GPUs can now begin experimenting with training models using the `xTorch` library via its new ROCm backend.</li>
            <li><strong>A Commitment to Openness:</strong> This signals our long-term commitment to supporting a diverse hardware ecosystem.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Our Roadmap</h3>
        <p>This is just the beginning. Our roadmap includes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Achieving full, production-ready support for `xTorch` training on AMD.</li>
            <li>Integrating support for AMD's inference engine into `xInfer`.</li>
            <li>Eventually adding AMD GPUs as a target platform on the `Ignition Hub`.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Building the Future, Together</h2>
        <p>This is a massive undertaking, and we are looking for community contributions. If you are an expert in ROCm, HIP, or AMD hardware, we invite you to join us on this journey. By working together, we can build a truly open, high-performance ecosystem for the entire AI industry.</p>
        <p>Check out the `rocm-dev` branch on our <a href="https://github.com/your-username/xtorch">`xTorch` GitHub repository</a> to get started.</p>
