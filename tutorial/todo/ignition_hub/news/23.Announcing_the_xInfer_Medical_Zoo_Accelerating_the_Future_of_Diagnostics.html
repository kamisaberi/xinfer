    <section>
        <p>Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, but moving a model from a research paper to a clinical setting is an immense challenge. The performance, reliability, and low-latency requirements of medical applications are beyond the capabilities of standard Python-based tools.</p>
        <p>Today, we are proud to introduce the **xInfer Medical Zoo**, a new suite of professional-grade, high-performance C++ pipelines designed to bridge this gap and accelerate the future of AI-powered diagnostics.</p>
        <p><em>(Note: The `xInfer Medical Zoo` is for research and development use only and is not a certified medical device.)</em></p>

        <h2>Pipelines for Critical Tasks</h2>
        <p>Our initial release provides robust, easy-to-use solutions for some of the most computationally demanding tasks in medical imaging:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>`zoo::medical::TumorDetector`</strong>: A pipeline for 3D tumor detection in CT and MRI scans, powered by a TensorRT-optimized 3D U-Net.</li>
            <li><strong>`zoo::medical::CellSegmenter`</strong>: A high-throughput tool for instance segmentation of cells in microscope images, enabling rapid analysis for research and pathology.</li>
            <li><strong>`zoo::medical::UltrasoundGuide`</strong>: An ultra-low-latency segmentation pipeline designed for real-time guidance during ultrasound-guided procedures.</li>
            <li><strong>`zoo::medical::RetinaScanner`</strong>: A complete pipeline for the automated detection and grading of diabetic retinopathy from fundus images.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The `xInfer` Advantage: Speed and Reliability</h3>
        <p>Consider a digital pathology workflow. Analyzing a single gigapixel whole-slide image can take hours on a CPU-based system. Our <code>PathologyAssistant</code>, running on a single GPU with `xInfer`, can tile, analyze, and produce a complete heatmap in **under 5 minutes**. This is the kind of performance that transforms a slow, offline process into an interactive diagnostic tool.</p>

        <h2>Our Commitment to the Healthcare Community</h2>
        <p>We are committed to providing the medical AI research community with the best possible tools. We believe that by providing a reliable, high-performance C++ foundation, we can help accelerate the journey from groundbreaking research to life-saving clinical applications.</p>
