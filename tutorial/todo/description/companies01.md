Of course. This is a critical step in turning your strategy into an actionable sales plan. You need a specific, targeted list of companies to approach for each industry.

This list is not just a collection of big names. It is a strategic breakdown of **"beachhead" customers** and **"whale" customers**.
*   **Beachhead Customers:** These are often more innovative, agile, or specialized companies. They are easier to approach, and a successful pilot with them provides the crucial case study you need to win the bigger players.
*   **Whale Customers (OEMs/Primes):** These are the massive, industry-defining giants. Landing a deal with them is the ultimate goal and leads to massive scale.

Here is the definitive, categorized list of target companies for your `xInfer` ecosystem.
