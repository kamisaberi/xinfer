        <p>Ignition AI is a successful commercial software company with a powerful secret. We are using our world-class, high-performance AI infrastructure to build a new kind of defense company, and we are looking for the founding members of our new division: **Aegis Sky**.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to build the "Aura Perception Engine," a real-time, multi-sensor fusion system that provides a decisive advantage to our armed forces. This is a "deep tech" problem that requires a unique combination of skills, passion, and a commitment to the mission.</p>

        <h2>Who We Are Looking For</h2>
        <p>We are not a typical defense contractor. We are a fast-moving, agile, and engineering-first company. We are hiring for a small number of critical, high-impact roles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Principal Robotics/Perception Scientist:</strong> The chief architect of our sensor fusion and tracking algorithms. A world-class expert in 3D computer vision and state estimation.</li>
            <li><strong>Senior Embedded Systems Engineer (C++):</strong> The owner of the software stack on our ruggedized NVIDIA Jetson hardware. An expert in real-time systems and low-level driver integration.</li>
            <li><strong>Hardware/RF Engineer:</strong> The engineer who will design our physical sensor pod, manage sensor integration (RADAR, EO/IR), and oversee MIL-STD environmental testing.</li>
            <li><strong>Head of Government Relations:</strong> A seasoned defense industry veteran to lead our business development and navigate the government procurement process.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Why Aegis Sky?</h2>
        <p>This is a rare opportunity to join a well-funded, commercially successful company at the very beginning of its most ambitious and impactful venture. You will have the resources of a growth-stage startup and the "unfair advantage" of using our internal `xInfer` and `Ignition Hub` platforms to iterate at a speed that is unheard of in the industry.</p>
        <p>If you are an expert in your field and you want to work on a mission-critical problem with a team that is built on a foundation of elite engineering, we want to hear from you.</p>
