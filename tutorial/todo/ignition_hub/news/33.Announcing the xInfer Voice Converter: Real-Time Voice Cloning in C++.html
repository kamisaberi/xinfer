        <p>Generative audio has reached an inflection point. Beyond simple text-to-speech, modern AI can now capture the unique characteristics of a person's voice and transfer it to new speech. This is **voice conversion**, and it has the potential to revolutionize everything from gaming to content creation.</p>
        <p>The challenge has been latency. Most high-quality voice conversion models are too slow for real-time, interactive use. Today, we're solving that with the launch of the **`xInfer::zoo::generative::VoiceConverter`**.</p>

        <h2>How It Works: A Three-Stage Pipeline</h2>
        <p>Our `VoiceConverter` is a complete, end-to-end pipeline that runs entirely on the GPU for maximum speed:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Encoder:</strong> A model extracts the content (the words being said) and the linguistic features from the source audio.</li>
            <li><strong>Speaker Embedding:</strong> A separate model takes a small, 5-second sample of the target voice and creates a unique "voice print" embedding.</li>
            <li><strong>Decoder & Vocoder:</strong> The main generative model takes the content from step 1 and the voice print from step 2 and synthesizes a new mel-spectrogram. This is then passed to a hyper-optimized vocoder engine to create the final audio waveform.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>By compiling each of these models into a TensorRT engine and orchestrating them in a tight C++ loop, we can perform high-fidelity voice conversion with a latency low enough for interactive applications.</p>

        <h3>Example Usage</h3>
        <pre><code>#include &lt;xinfer/zoo/generative/voice_converter.h&gt;

int main() {
    // 1. Initialize the pipeline with your pre-built engines
    xinfer::zoo::generative::VoiceConverterConfig config;
    config.engine_path = "voice_conversion.engine";
    xinfer::zoo::generative::VoiceConverter converter(config);

    // 2. Load the source speech and a sample of the target voice
    AudioWaveform source_audio = load_wav("source_speech.wav");
    AudioWaveform target_voice_sample = load_wav("target_voice_sample.wav");

    // 3. Perform the conversion
    AudioWaveform converted_audio = converter.predict(source_audio, target_voice_sample);

    // 4. Save the result
    save_wav("converted_output.wav", converted_audio);
}
            </code></pre>

        <h2>Unlocking New Applications</h2>
        <p>Real-time voice conversion in C++ is a game-changer. Game developers can now allow players to speak with the voice of their in-game character. Dubbing studios can rapidly prototype different voices for a film. Content creators can create dynamic, AI-powered virtual assistants with unique personas.</p>
        <p>This is another step in our mission to bring the full power of generative AI to the world of high-performance native applications. Learn more in our <a href="/docs/zoo-api/generative.html">Generative AI Zoo documentation</a>.</p>
