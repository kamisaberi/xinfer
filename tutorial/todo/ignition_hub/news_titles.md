Of course. Creating a "News" or "Blog" section for your website is a brilliant marketing strategy. It's the perfect way to announce new features, showcase your technical expertise, and build a community around your projects.

The key is to have titles that are exciting, informative, and targeted to your specific audience of expert C++ AI developers. Here is a comprehensive list of news titles, categorized by their strategic purpose, that you can use to launch your website.

### **How to Use This List**

1.  **Launch Sequence:** Start by publishing the first **four "Big Bang" posts** on your launch day. This clearly explains what each part of your ecosystem is.
2.  **Weekly Content Cadence:** In the following weeks, publish one **"Performance Benchmark"** post and one **"How-To"** post each week. The benchmarks prove your value, and the tutorials drive adoption.
3.  **Strategic Vision Posts:** Intersperse the technical content with the **"Vision & Roadmap"** posts every month or two to keep your community and potential investors excited about the future.

This content strategy will establish your company not just as a provider of a tool, but as a **thought leader** and the central authority in the high-performance C++ AI space.
