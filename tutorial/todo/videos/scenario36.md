### **The Complete Video Script**

**(0:00 - 1:00) - The Introduction: The Challenge**

*   **(Visual):** Opens with a clean title card: **"The Full Stack C++ Workflow: From Training to a Real-Time App in 20 Minutes."**
*   **(Visual):** You are on screen in a small circle. The main screen shows a clean, empty C++ project in your IDE.
*   **You (speaking to camera):** "Hello everyone. Kamran here. Today, we're going to do something that many people believe is impossible: we are going to build, train, optimize, and deploy a complete, real-time AI application, from scratch, in under 20 minutes. And we're going to do it all in **100% C++**."
*   **(Visual):** You bring up a simple problem statement on the screen.
    *   **Goal:** Build a real-time application that can detect if a person in a webcam feed is wearing a safety helmet.
    *   **Challenge:** We only have a small, custom dataset.
    *   **Performance Target:** Must run at >60 FPS on a standard developer GPU.
*   **You (speaking to camera):** "This is a classic real-world problem. We'll use our `xTorch` library to train the model, the `xinfer-cli` to optimize it, and the `xInfer::zoo` to build the final application. Let's start the clock."
*   **(Visual):** A timer appears in the corner of the screen and starts counting up from `00:00`.

**(1:01 - 8:00) - Part 1: The `xTorch` Training Phase**

*   **(Music):** Music fades out completely.
*   **(Visual):** You are in your C++ IDE.
*   **You (voiceover, as you code):** "Okay, first step: we need to train a model. Our dataset is in a simple `ImageFolder` format, with 'helmet' and 'no_helmet' subdirectories. `xTorch` makes this easy."
*   **(Visual):** You quickly write the `xTorch` C++ code for the training script.
    ```cpp
    // train_helmet_detector.cpp
    #include <xtorch/xtorch.h>

    int main() {
        // 1. Define data augmentation and loading
        auto transforms = xt::transforms::Compose({...});
        auto dataset = xt::datasets::ImageFolder("path/to/helmet_data", transforms);
        xt::dataloaders::ExtendedDataLoader loader(dataset, 32, true);

        // 2. Load a pre-trained ResNet18 and replace the final layer
        auto model = xt::models::ResNet18(true); // Load with pre-trained weights
        model->fc = xt::nn::Linear(512, 2); // Adapt for our 2 classes

        // 3. Set up the trainer
        torch::optim::Adam optimizer(model->parameters(), 1e-4);
        xt::Trainer trainer;
        trainer.set_max_epochs(5).set_optimizer(optimizer);
        
        // 4. Train the model
        trainer.fit(model, loader);

        // 5. Save our fine-tuned model
        xt::save(model, "helmet_detector.xt");
    }
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "Notice how familiar this is. We define our dataset and transforms, load a pre-trained model from the `xTorch` zoo, replace the head, and then call `.fit()`. It's the exact same logic as PyTorch, but it's all compiled C++."
*   **(Visual):** You switch to the terminal, compile the training script, and run it. The `xTorch` training log appears, showing the epochs and loss decreasing. You can time-lapse this part slightly.
*   **You (voiceover):** "And because this is native C++, our data loading is incredibly efficient, and we're getting the maximum performance out of the GPU during training. After a few minutes, our model is trained, and we have our `helmet_detector.xt` weights file."

**(8:01 - 12:00) - Part 2: The `xInfer` Optimization Phase**

*   **(Visual):** You are back in the terminal. The timer on screen reads around `08:00`.
*   **You (voiceover):** "Now for the critical step. We need to convert our trained `xTorch` model into a hyper-optimized TensorRT engine. This is where `xInfer` comes in. First, we'll use a utility to export to the standard ONNX format."
*   **(Visual):** You run a command (or a script that uses `xinfer::builders::export_to_onnx`).
    ```bash
    # (This could be a helper script)
    export_xtorch_to_onnx --model helmet_detector.xt --output helmet_detector.onnx
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "With our model in ONNX format, we can now use the `xinfer-cli` to build our production engine. We'll enable FP16 for a serious speed boost."
*   **(Visual):** You type and execute the `xinfer-cli` build command.
    ```bash
    xinfer-cli --build \
        --onnx helmet_detector.onnx \
        --save_engine helmet_detector_fp16.engine \
        --fp16 \
        --batch 1
    ```
*   **(Visual):** The TensorRT build log scrolls by.
*   **You (voiceover):** "This single command is doing an incredible amount of work: parsing the graph, applying fusions, and running a series of benchmarks to select the fastest possible CUDA kernels for our specific GPU. This is the 'F1 car' build process, fully automated."
*   **(Visual):** The command finishes. You now have the `helmet_detector_fp16.engine` file.

**(12:01 - 18:00) - Part 3: The Real-Time Application**

*   **(Visual):** You are in a new `main.cpp` file for the final application. The timer reads around `12:00`.
*   **You (voiceover):** "Okay, we have our optimized engine. Let's build the final application. We want to read from a webcam and classify each frame in real-time. With the `xInfer::zoo`, this is incredibly simple."
*   **(Visual):** You write the final C++ application code.
    ```cpp
    #include <xinfer/zoo/vision/classifier.h>
    #include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
    #include <iostream>

    int main() {
        // 1. Configure and initialize the classifier with our new engine
        xinfer::zoo::vision::ClassifierConfig config;
        config.engine_path = "helmet_detector_fp16.engine";
        config.labels_path = "helmet_labels.txt"; // "no_helmet", "helmet"
        
        xinfer::zoo::vision::ImageClassifier classifier(config);
        
        // 2. Open the webcam
        cv::VideoCapture cap(0);
        if (!cap.isOpened()) {
            std::cerr << "Error: Could not open webcam.\n";
            return 1;
        }

        // 3. The real-time inference loop
        cv::Mat frame;
        while (true) {
            cap >> frame;
            if (frame.empty()) break;

            // 4. Predict! This is the only line of AI code in our hot loop.
            auto results = classifier.predict(frame, 1);
            
            // 5. Draw the results on the frame
            auto& top_result = results[0];
            cv::Scalar color = (top_result.label == "helmet") ? cv::Scalar(0, 255, 0) : cv::Scalar(0, 0, 255);
            cv::putText(frame, top_result.label + ": " + std::to_string(top_result.confidence), 
                        cv::Point(10, 30), cv::FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1.0, color, 2);

            cv::imshow("xInfer Real-Time Helmet Detection", frame);
            if (cv::waitKey(1) == 27) break; // Exit on ESC
        }
        return 0;
    }
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "Look at this loop. It's clean, simple OpenCV code. The entire complexity of the AI pipeline—pre-processing, inference, and post-processing—is handled by that single `.predict()` call. That's the power of the `zoo`."

**(18:01 - 19:30) - The Final Result**

*   **(Visual):** You compile and run the application. A webcam feed appears on screen.
*   **You (speaking to camera):** "Okay, let's see it in action."
*   **(Visual):** You are visible in the webcam feed. The text "no_helmet" is displayed in red. You then put on a safety helmet. The text instantly switches to "helmet" in green. You take it off and on a few times, showing the instant, real-time response.
*   **You (voiceover):** "And there it is. The response is instantaneous. We're running a state-of-the-art model in a tight C++ loop, with a total end-to-end latency of just a few milliseconds."
*   **(Visual):** The timer in the corner stops at around `19:30`.
*   **You (speaking to camera):** "So, from a custom dataset to a fully trained, hyper-optimized, real-time C++ application... in under 20 minutes."

**(19:31 - 20:00) - The Conclusion**

*   **(Visual):** Final slate with the Ignition AI logo.
*   **You (voiceover):** "This is the workflow that the Ignition AI ecosystem enables. It's a seamless, end-to-end path from idea to production, built for the developers who build the future."
*   **(Visual):** The website URL fades in: **aryorithm.com**
*   **(Music):** The intro/outro track fades in and finishes. Fade to black.
