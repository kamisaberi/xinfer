        <p>The first wave of the AI revolution was defined by the cloud. Massive data centers with thousands of GPUs were necessary to train the large models that power applications like ChatGPT and Midjourney. But this is just the beginning of the story.</p>
        <p>The next, and arguably more profound, wave of AI will not happen in a distant data center. It will happen right here, in the physical world. It will run on the drones that inspect our infrastructure, the robots in our factories, the medical devices in our hospitals, and the cars on our roads.</p>
        <p>This is the world of **Edge AI**, and it is a world that runs on a different set of rules.</p>

        <h2>The Three Laws of the Edge</h2>
        <p>Unlike the cloud, the edge is constrained by physics. Three factors are paramount:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Latency is Law:</strong> For a self-driving car or a surgical robot, the speed of light is a real constraint. You cannot afford a round-trip to the cloud to make a decision. The computation must happen locally, in milliseconds.</li>
            <li><strong>Power is Everything:</strong> Edge devices run on batteries. Every watt of power consumed by the AI chip reduces the drone's flight time or the wearable's battery life. Performance-per-watt is the single most important metric.</li>
            <li><strong>Connectivity is a Myth:</strong> A factory robot, a remote sensor, or a military system cannot assume it will have a stable internet connection. The AI must be fully autonomous and capable of operating offline.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Why This Demands a New Stack</h2>
        <p>The slow, power-hungry, and cloud-dependent Python-based software stack that dominates AI research is fundamentally unsuited for this new reality. The future of Edge AI will be built on a foundation of high-performance, efficient, and reliable C++ systems.</p>
        <p>This is the core thesis behind Ignition AI. We are building the tools—<code>xTorch</code>, <code>xInfer</code>, and the <code>Ignition Hub</code>—that will empower the next generation of engineers to build this intelligent edge. Our obsession with performance, our focus on the C++ ecosystem, and our expertise in low-level GPU optimization are all in service of this single vision.</p>
        <p>The companies that win the next decade of AI will not be the ones with the biggest models in the cloud. They will be the ones who can deploy the smartest, most efficient intelligence into the physical world. That is the future we are building.</p>
