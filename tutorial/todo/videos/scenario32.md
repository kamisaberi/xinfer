Of course. This is the perfect video to follow your community-focused message. You've invited people to contribute. Now, you need to provide them with the ultimate tool to do so.

This video is a **product launch for a major new feature**: the **`xTorch` C++ API for Custom `zoo` Pipelines**. It's a deep, technical, and empowering video for your most advanced users.

The goal is to show expert developers that `xInfer` is not just a collection of pre-built solutions, but a powerful **framework** that they can use to build and even distribute their *own* "F1 car" pipelines.

### **Video 32: "Go Beyond the Zoo: Building Your Own Custom Pipelines with xInfer"**

**Video Style:** A professional, "conference workshop" style screencast. It's a code-heavy, step-by-step guide. The primary visual is your IDE, where you build a new, custom `zoo` class from scratch.
**Music:** A focused, intelligent, and minimalist electronic track. The music should be in the background and not distract from the technical content.
**Presenter:** You, Kamran Saberifard. Your tone is that of a **Principal Architect** teaching a masterclass to other senior engineers.

### **The Complete Video Script**

**(0:00 - 0:45) - The Introduction: The Limits of a "Zoo"**

*   **(Visual):** Opens with a clean title card: **"Go Beyond the Zoo: Building Your Own Custom Pipelines with `xInfer`."**
*   **(Visual):** Cut to you in the corner of the screen. The main screen shows the extensive `xInfer::zoo` documentation page, scrolling through the long list of pre-built solutions.
*   **You (speaking to camera):** "Hello everyone. The `xInfer::zoo` provides a powerful, one-line solution for over 100 common AI tasks. But what happens when your problem is unique? What if you've trained a custom, multi-head model that doesn't fit a standard pattern? Do you have to abandon the `zoo` and build everything from scratch with the Core API?"
*   **(Visual):** A diagram shows the `zoo` as a collection of beautiful, finished "F1 cars." An arrow points from them to a box labeled "Your Custom Model," but the connection is broken with a red "X."
*   **You (speaking to camera):** "Until today, the answer was yes. But we believe that the power and simplicity of the `zoo` shouldn't be limited to the solutions we provide. Today, we are introducing a new **`xInfer` SDK** that allows you to build your **own** custom `zoo` classes."

**(0:46 - 2:00) - The Goal: Building a "Weather Forecaster"**

*   **(Visual):** Switch to your C++ IDE. You have a clean project structure.
*   **You (voiceover):** "To demonstrate this, we're going to build a new, custom `zoo` pipeline from scratch. Let's imagine we have a custom, multi-input weather forecasting model."
*   **(Visual):** You type the model's description as comments.
    ```cpp
    // Our Custom Weather Model (pre-built as weather_forecaster.engine)
    // Input 1: Historical Temperature Data (Time-Series)
    // Input 2: Satellite Image of Cloud Cover (Image)
    // Output 1: Predicted Temperature for the next 24 hours.
    // Output 2: A segmentation mask of predicted rainfall.
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "This is a multi-modal model that doesn't fit into our standard `Classifier` or `Forecaster` classes. We're going to build a new, high-level class called `WeatherForecaster` that provides a simple `.predict()` API for this complex model."
*   **(Visual):** You show the final, desired user experience code.
    ```cpp
    // The goal: A simple API for our custom model
    WeatherForecaster forecaster("weather_forecaster.engine");
    auto result = forecaster.predict(historical_temps, satellite_image);
    // Use result.temperature_forecast and result.rainfall_mask
    ```*   **You (voiceover):** "This is our goal. A clean, simple API for a complex, custom pipeline. Let's build it."

**(2:01 - 7:00) - The "How-To": Building the Custom `zoo` Class**

*This is the core of the video. You will walk through the creation of the `WeatherForecaster.h` and `.cpp` files, explaining each step.*

*   **Part 1: The Header File (`WeatherForecaster.h`)**
    *   **(Visual):** You create the header file.
    *   **You (voiceover):** "First, we define our public interface. We create a `WeatherResult` struct to hold our custom outputs, and the `WeatherForecaster` class. We'll use the PIMPL idiom to hide all the internal complexity, just like our own `zoo` classes do."
    *   **(Visual):** You type out the `WeatherForecaster.h` file, including the config, the result struct, and the class definition with its `pimpl_` pointer.

*   **Part 2: The Implementation File (`WeatherForecaster.cpp`)**
    *   **(Visual):** You create the `.cpp` file and the `Impl` struct.
    *   **You (voiceover):** "Now for the implementation. Our `Impl` struct will hold the low-level `xInfer` components: the `InferenceEngine` and two different `preproc` objects, one for the time-series data and one for the image."
        ```cpp
        struct WeatherForecaster::Impl {
            std::unique_ptr<core::InferenceEngine> engine_;
            std::unique_ptr<preproc::TimeSeriesProcessor> ts_preprocessor_; // A new hypothetical preproc
            std::unique_ptr<preproc::ImageProcessor> img_preprocessor_;
        };
        ```
    *   **You (voiceover):** "The constructor is straightforward. It loads the engine and initializes our pre-processors."

*   **Part 3: The `predict()` Method**
    *   **(Visual):** You implement the `predict` method step-by-step.
    *   **You (voiceover):** "The `predict` method is where we orchestrate the pipeline. First, we pre-process our two different inputs into two separate GPU tensors."
        ```cpp
        // Pre-process the time-series data
        auto ts_input_tensor = pimpl_->ts_preprocessor_->process(historical_temps);
        
        // Pre-process the satellite image
        auto img_input_tensor = pimpl_->img_preprocessor_->process(satellite_image);
        ```
    *   **You (voiceover):** "Next, we pass a vector of our input tensors to the `engine_->infer()` method. The order must match what the model expects."
        ```cpp
        // Run inference
        auto output_tensors = pimpl_->engine_->infer({ts_input_tensor, img_input_tensor});
        ```
    *   **You (voiceover):** "Finally, we unpack the output tensors, perform any necessary post-processing, and populate our `WeatherResult` struct."
        ```cpp
        // Post-process the results
        WeatherResult result;
        output_tensors[0].copy_to_host(result.temperature_forecast.data());
        result.rainfall_mask = postproc::argmax_to_mat(output_tensors[1]);
        
        return result;
        ```

**(7:01 - 7:45) - The Conclusion: An Extensible Framework**

*   **(Visual):** You run the final example code that uses your new `WeatherForecaster` class. It works perfectly.
*   **You (speaking to camera):** "And there you have it. In just a few minutes, we've built our own custom, high-performance `zoo` pipeline. We leveraged the power of `xInfer`'s low-level primitives—the engine, the pre-processors, the post-processors—to create a new, high-level abstraction for our unique model."
*   **(Visual):** A final graphic shows the `xInfer Core Toolkit` as a foundation, with the official `zoo` and a new box for "Your Custom `zoo`" both building on top of it.
*   **You (voiceover):** "This is the true power of `xInfer`. It is not a closed system. It is an extensible framework. We provide a powerful `zoo` out-of-the-box, but we also give you the tools to build your own high-performance solutions for any problem, no matter how specialized."

**(7:46 - 8:00) - The Call to Action**

*   **(Visual):** Final slate with the Ignition AI logo.
*   **You (voiceover):** "What will you build? Check out our new 'Custom Pipelines' guide in the documentation and show us what you can create."
*   **(Visual):** The website URL fades in: **aryorithm.com/docs**
*   **(Music):** Final, inspiring, and empowering musical sting. Fade to black.
