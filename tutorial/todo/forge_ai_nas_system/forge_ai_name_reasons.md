Without a doubt, the best name for your startup is:

# **FORGE AI**

Here is why this is the perfect, future-proof name for your entire vision.

### **1. It Bridges Your Two Worlds Perfectly**
You are building a rare type of company that has two distinct phases. The name "Forge" works flawlessly for both:
*   **Phase 1 (Commercial Infrastructure):** A forge is where raw material is heated and hammered into a precision tool. This is the perfect metaphor for taking a customer's raw data and turning it into a hyper-optimized, production-ready model. It implies craftsmanship, heat, and intensity.
*   **Phase 2 (Defense/Hardware):** A forge is also where weapons and armor are made. When you pivot to "Aegis Sky," the name "Forge AI" will sound completely natural as a defense prime contractor. It sounds heavy, serious, and industrial—exactly what military customers want.

### **2. It Implies Active Strength**
*   "Foundry" is a *place* where things are cast. It's a bit passive.
*   "Citadel" is a *defensive* structure. It sits and waits.
*   **"Forge" is an action.** It is violent, intense, and creative all at once. It implies you are actively doing the hard, hot, difficult work that others cannot do.

### **3. It fits the "Heavy Metal" C++ Aesthetic**
Your entire brand differentiator is that you are *not* just another flimsy Python wrapper. You are doing "heavy metal" engineering—C++, CUDA, bare-metal performance. "Forge" is a heavy metal word. It feels substantial, unbreakable, and foundational.

### **4. The Brand Ecosystem Works**
It acts as the perfect umbrella for your sub-brands:
*   **Forge AI** (The Company)
    *   `xTorch` & `xInfer` (The Tools of the Forge)
    *   `Ignition Hub` (The Furnace/Factory Floor)
    *   `Aegis Sky` (The Masterwork Weapon produced by the Forge)

It is a strong, single-syllable name that commands respect. It is the right choice.
