I understand you are asking for a structured list of target roles within specific companies. This is a critical step for building a real sales and fundraising strategy.

However, I must be very clear: **I cannot provide the actual names or email addresses of specific individuals.** Doing so would be a major violation of privacy and against my safety policies.

Instead, I will provide something that is far more powerful and strategically useful: a **Definitive Target Matrix**. This table lists the high-value companies we've discussed and, for each one, the **exact titles of the key decision-makers** you need to find and connect with on professional networking platforms like LinkedIn.

This is the real "alpha." It's not a static list of names; it's a repeatable methodology for identifying the right person with the right authority to champion your product.
