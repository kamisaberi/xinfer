Of course. This is the perfect next video in the sequence.

1.  **Video 1 (Launch):** Established the grand vision.
2.  **Video 2 (xTorch Benchmark):** Proved your training performance with scientific rigor.
3.  **Video 3 (xInfer Kernels):** Delivered the "wow moment" with a visceral, side-by-side speed comparison.

Now, for **Video 4**, we need to tie it all together into a complete, practical, and aspirational workflow. This video is the **"Quickstart Guide."** Its goal is to take a new developer, empower them, and make them feel like a hero in under 10 minutes.

Here is the definitive script for your "Quickstart" video.

### **Video 4: "The 5-Minute Quickstart: Your First High-Performance C++ AI App with xInfer"**

**Video Style:** A clean, crisp, and follow-along screen recording. You are the guide, speaking directly to the viewer. The pace is brisk but easy to follow. Every command is shown on screen, and every line of code is explained.
**Music:** An upbeat, positive, and modern electronic track. It should feel encouraging and productive.
**Presenter:** You, Kamran Saberifard. Your tone is that of a helpful and expert mentor.

### **The Complete Video Script**

**(0:00 - 0:45) - The Promise: From Zero to Real-Time AI**

*   **(Visual):** Opens with a clean, full-screen title card: **"The 5-Minute Quickstart to High-Performance C++ AI."**
*   **(Visual):** Cut to you, in a small, friendly circle in the corner of the screen. The main screen is your clean desktop/IDE.
*   **You (speaking to camera):** "Hello, and welcome to the `xInfer` quickstart guide. My name is Kamran, and I'm the founder of Aryorithm. In the next few minutes, we are going to build a complete, high-performance C++ object detection application from scratch."
*   **(Visual):** A quick, exciting montage (2 seconds) of the final result: a video with smooth, real-time bounding boxes being drawn around objects.
*   **You (speaking to camera):** "We're going to go from a standard, open-source AI model to a hyper-optimized, real-time C++ application. We'll do it in three simple steps: Get a model, optimize it with our `xinfer-cli`, and then use it with our simple `zoo` API. Let's get started."

**(0:46 - 2:00) - Step 1: Get a Pre-Trained Model**

*   **(Visual):** Full-screen terminal. You are in an empty project directory.
*   **You (voiceover):** "First, we need a model. For this, we'll use the popular YOLOv8-Nano, a great real-time object detector. We'll grab the ONNX version, which is a standard format that `xInfer` understands."
*   **(Visual):** You type and execute the `wget` commands on screen to download `yolov8n.onnx` and `coco.names` into an `assets` folder.
    ```bash
    mkdir assets
    wget https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8n.onnx -O assets/yolov8n.onnx
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/master/data/coco.names -O assets/coco.names
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "And that's it. We now have our trained model and the class names. This is the only part of the process that isn't handled by our own tools."

**(2:01 - 4:00) - Step 2: Build the "F1 Car" Engine**

*   **(Visual):** Still in the terminal. You navigate to the `xinfer/build/tools/xinfer-cli` directory.
*   **You (voiceover):** "Now for the most important step. We're going to use the `xinfer-cli` tool to convert this generic ONNX file into a hyper-optimized TensorRT engine. This is the ahead-of-time compilation that gives `xInfer` its incredible speed."
*   **(Visual):** You type and execute the `xinfer-cli` build command.
    ```bash
    ./xinfer-cli --build \
        --onnx ../../assets/yolov8n.onnx \
        --save_engine ../../assets/yolov8n_fp16.engine \
        --fp16
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "Let's break this down. We're telling the CLI to `build` a new engine. We provide the input `onnx` file and the path to `save_engine`. The most important part is the `--fp16` flag. This tells TensorRT to use fast, half-precision math, which can double the performance on modern NVIDIA GPUs."
*   **(Visual):** The screen shows the TensorRT build log scrolling by. You can fast-forward this part slightly.
*   **You (voiceover):** "The builder is now analyzing the model, fusing layers, and selecting the fastest possible CUDA kernels for your specific GPU. This is a complex process that would normally take hundreds of lines of code, but the CLI automates it all."
*   **(Visual):** The command finishes. You run `ls -lh assets` to show the new `yolov8n_fp16.engine` file.
*   **You (voiceover):** "And we're done. We now have our 'F1 car' engine, ready to be deployed."

**(4:01 - 8:30) - Step 3: Use the Engine in C++ (The Payoff)**

*   **(Visual):** Switch to your IDE (like VS Code or CLion). You have an empty `main.cpp` file open.
*   **You (voiceover):** "Okay, now for the fun part. Let's use our new engine in a simple C++ application. We're going to use the `xInfer::zoo`, which is our high-level API designed to make this incredibly simple."
*   **(Visual):** You start typing the C++ code, explaining each line as you go.
    ```cpp
    #include <xinfer/zoo/vision/detector.h>
    #include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
    #include <iostream>
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "First, we include the headers we need. The most important one is our `zoo::vision::detector.h`."

    ```cpp
    int main() {
        // 1. Configure the detector
        xinfer::zoo::vision::DetectorConfig config;
        config.engine_path = "assets/yolov8n_fp16.engine";
        config.labels_path = "assets/coco.names";
        config.confidence_threshold = 0.5f;
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "Next, in our main function, we create a configuration struct. We simply tell it where to find the engine file we just built and the labels file."

    ```cpp
        // 2. Initialize the detector
        std::cout << "Loading object detector...\n";
        xinfer::zoo::vision::ObjectDetector detector(config);
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "Now, we instantiate the `ObjectDetector`. This one line loads the engine, sets up the pre- and post-processing kernels, and gets everything ready."

    ```cpp
        // 3. Load an image and predict
        cv::Mat image = cv::imread("assets/street_scene.jpg"); // Assume this image exists
        if (image.empty()) {
            std::cerr << "Error: Could not load image!\n";
            return 1;
        }

        std::vector<xinfer::zoo::vision::BoundingBox> detections = detector.predict(image);
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "And here's the magic. We load an image with OpenCV, and then call `.predict()`. This single function call runs the entire, hyper-optimized pipeline: pre-processing on the GPU, TensorRT inference, and our custom NMS kernel for post-processing."

    ```cpp
        // 4. Draw the results
        std::cout << "Found " << detections.size() << " objects.\n";
        for (const auto& box : detections) {
            cv::rectangle(image, cv::Point(box.x1, box.y1), cv::Point(box.x2, box.y2), cv::Scalar(0, 255, 0), 2);
            cv::putText(image, box.label, cv::Point(box.x1, box.y1 - 5), cv::FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, cv::Scalar(0, 255, 0), 2);
        }
        cv::imwrite("output.jpg", image);
        std::cout << "Saved annotated image to output.jpg\n";
    
        return 0;
    }
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "Finally, we just loop through the clean vector of `BoundingBox` structs that `predict` returns, and draw them on the image. Let's build and run it."
*   **(Visual):** Switch back to the terminal. You compile and run the new executable. The program prints the number of detections, and then you open the `output.jpg` file to show the final, annotated image.
*   **You (voiceover):** "And there it is. A complete, high-performance C++ AI application, and it was that simple."

**(8:31 - 9:00) - The Conclusion: Your Next Steps**

*   **(Visual):** Cut back to you in the corner of the screen. The main screen shows your GitHub page.
*   **You (speaking to camera):** "So, in just a few minutes, we went from a standard ONNX file to a real-time C++ application, all thanks to the `xInfer` ecosystem. We handled the complex part, so you can focus on building your product."
*   **(Visual):** Final slate with the Ignition AI logo.
*   **You (voiceover):** "To get started, check out our projects on GitHub, and explore the `zoo` documentation to see all the other powerful pipelines you can build."
*   **(Visual):** The website URL fades in: **aryorithm.com**
*   **(Music):** Fades out.
