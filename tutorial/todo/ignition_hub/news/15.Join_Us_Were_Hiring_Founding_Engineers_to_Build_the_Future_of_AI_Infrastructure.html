        <p>At Ignition AI, we have a simple and audacious goal: to build the foundational software that will power the next decade of real-world artificial intelligence. We are the company that builds the "F1 cars" for an industry that is tired of driving sedans.</p>
        <p>Our `xTorch` and `xInfer` ecosystem is gaining traction, our vision for the `Ignition Hub` is clear, and we are now looking for a small number of elite, passionate engineers to join us as part of our founding team.</p>

        <h2>Who We Are Looking For</h2>
        <p>We are not a typical software company. We are a small team of specialists obsessed with performance, from the metal up. We are looking for engineers who get excited about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Writing clean, modern C++20 and pushing the language to its limits.</li>
            <li>Diving deep into the CUDA programming model to write novel, fused kernels.</li>
            <li>Deconstructing the internals of NVIDIA's TensorRT compiler to extract every last drop of performance.</li>
            <li>Architecting scalable, distributed cloud systems that can build thousands of AI models in parallel.</li>
            <li>Solving problems that others have deemed "impossible."</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Problems You Will Solve</h2>
        <p>As a founding engineer, you won't be a small cog in a big machine. You will be a primary architect of our core products:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Build the "Fusion Forge":</strong> Design and implement new, hyper-optimized CUDA kernels for the next generation of AI architectures like Mamba and GNNs.</li>
            <li><strong>Architect the "Ignition Hub":</strong> Build the scalable, Kubernetes-based cloud platform that will become the backbone of our SaaS business.</li>
            <li><strong>Expand the "Zoo":</strong> Create new, high-level C++ solutions for exciting domains like medical imaging, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Join Us</h2>
        <p>If you believe that the future of AI will be written in high-performance C++, and you want to be one of the people writing it, we encourage you to apply.</p>
        <p>This is not just another job. This is an opportunity to build a foundational piece of technology for the entire AI industry, with a massive impact and significant equity as a founding team member.</p>
