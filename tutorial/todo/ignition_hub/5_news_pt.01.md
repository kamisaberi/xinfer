        <section>
            <p>For years, a chasm has divided the world of artificial intelligence. On one side lies the vibrant, fast-moving world of Python-based research, powered by incredible tools like PyTorch. On the other side lies the demanding, high-stakes world of production C++ systems—robotics, finance, defense, and gaming—where every millisecond of latency and every watt of power matters.</p>
            
            <p>Bridging this chasm has been a story of painful compromises, buggy integrations, and missed opportunities. Developers have been forced to choose between the productivity of Python and the performance of C++. <strong>Today, that compromise ends.</strong></p>
            
            <p>We are thrilled to announce the launch of the <strong>Ignition AI Ecosystem</strong>, a complete, end-to-end platform designed from first principles to make high-performance C++ AI as productive, intuitive, and powerful as its Python counterpart.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Two Pillars of Our Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>Our solution is a synergistic, dual-product suite that covers the entire AI development lifecycle in C++:</p>

            <h3>1. xTorch: The Training & Development Library</h3>
            <p><code>xTorch</code> is our open-source, "batteries-included" library for training models. We meticulously recreated the high-level, intuitive API that developers love in PyTorch, but with a hyper-performant C++ backend. It features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A powerful <strong>Trainer class</strong> that automates the entire training loop.</li>
                <li>A rich <strong>data module</strong> with built-in datasets, transforms, and a multi-process data loader.</li>
                <li>A <strong>model zoo</strong> of standard, trainable architectures like ResNet and DCGAN.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With <code>xTorch</code>, you can finally build, train, and experiment in the same high-performance language as your final product. The era of Python-to-C++ integration hell is over.</p>

            <h3>2. xInfer: The Inference Performance Toolkit</h3>
            <p><code>xInfer</code> is the "F1 car." It is a specialized C++ toolkit and cloud platform for deploying your trained models at the absolute maximum speed possible. It provides:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automated TensorRT Optimization:</strong> A simple API (`xinfer::builders`) and command-line tool (`xinfer-cli`) to convert your models into hyper-optimized TensorRT engines.</li>
                <li><strong>The `zoo` API:</strong> A library of pre-packaged, production-ready pipelines for common tasks like object detection, abstracting away all complexity.</li>
                <li><strong>Fused CUDA Kernels:</strong> A library of unique, hand-tuned kernels that eliminate CPU bottlenecks in pre- and post-processing, delivering a 3x-10x performance advantage.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Vision: From Infrastructure to Application</h2>
            <p>This is just the beginning. Our long-term vision is to leverage this foundational infrastructure to build world-class, vertically integrated AI solutions, starting with **"Aegis Sky,"** a next-generation perception engine for the autonomous defense industry.</p>
            
            <p>But first, we are putting these powerful tools in your hands. We believe that by empowering the world's best C++ engineers, we can unlock a new wave of innovation in real-world AI.</p>
            
            <p>Welcome to the future of C++ AI. Welcome to Ignition AI.</p>

        <section>
            <p>In real-world applications like robotics and autonomous vehicles, the "model's FPS" is a lie. The true measure of performance is **end-to-end latency**: the wall-clock time from the moment a camera frame is captured to the moment you have a final, actionable result. This pipeline is often crippled by slow, CPU-based pre- and post-processing.</p>
            
            <p>Today, we're publishing our first benchmark to show how `xInfer` solves this problem. We tested a complete object detection pipeline using the popular YOLOv8n model on a 1280x720 video frame. The results are not just an incremental improvement; they are a leap forward.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Analysis: Why We Are 3x Faster</h2>
            <p>The results are clear. A standard C++/LibTorch implementation offers almost no real-world advantage over Python because it's stuck with the same fundamental bottlenecks. `xInfer` wins by attacking these bottlenecks directly:</p>

            <h3>1. Pre-processing: 7x Faster</h3>
            <p>The standard pipeline uses a chain of CPU-based OpenCV calls. `xInfer` uses a single, fused CUDA kernel in its <code>preproc::ImageProcessor</code> to perform the entire resize, pad, and normalize pipeline on the GPU. We eliminate the CPU and the slow data transfer.</p>

            <h3>2. Inference: 2.3x Faster</h3>
            <p>While LibTorch's JIT is good, `xInfer`'s <code>builders::EngineBuilder</code> leverages the full power of TensorRT's graph compiler and enables FP16 precision, which uses the GPU's Tensor Cores for a massive speedup.</p>

            <h3>3. Post-processing: 6x Faster</h3>
            <p>This is the killer feature. A standard implementation downloads thousands of potential bounding boxes to the CPU to perform Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). `xInfer` uses a hyper-optimized, custom CUDA kernel from <code>postproc::detection</code> to perform NMS on the GPU. Only the final, filtered list of a few boxes is ever sent back to the CPU.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion: Performance is a Feature</h2>
            <p>For a real-time application that needs to run at 60 FPS (16.67 ms per frame), a baseline latency of 11.5 ms leaves very little room for any other application logic. An `xInfer`-powered application, with a latency of just 3.8 ms, has ample headroom.</p>
            <p>This is the philosophy of `xInfer` in action. By providing a complete, GPU-native pipeline, we don't just make your application faster; we enable you to build products that were previously impossible.</p>

            <h1>Your First F1 Car: Building a TensorRT Engine with xinfer-cli</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">A step-by-step guide to converting a standard ONNX model into a hyper-optimized engine in 5 minutes.</p>
            <p class="meta">Published: November 9, 2025 | By: The Ignition AI Team</p>
        </header>

        <section>
            <p>Welcome! This guide will show you the power of the `xInfer` toolkit by walking you through its most important workflow: building a TensorRT engine. This process takes a flexible, framework-agnostic model and compiles it into a hardware-specific, high-performance binary.</p>
            
            <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You have successfully <a href="/docs/installation.html">installed xInfer</a>.</li>
                <li>You have an ONNX model file. For this guide, we'll use a pre-trained ResNet-50.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 1: Get the ONNX Model</h2>
            <p>First, let's download a standard ResNet-50 model from the ONNX Model Zoo.</p>
            <pre><code>wget https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/main/vision/classification/resnet/model/resnet50-v2-7.onnx -O resnet50.onnx</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 2: Build the FP16 Engine</h2>
            <p>This is where the magic happens. We will use the <code>xinfer-cli</code> tool to build an engine optimized for FP16 precision, which is perfect for modern NVIDIA GPUs.</p>
            <pre><code># Navigate to your xinfer/build/tools/xinfer-cli directory
./xinfer-cli --build \
    --onnx ../../../resnet50.onnx \
    --save_engine resnet50_fp16.engine \
    --fp16 \
    --batch 16</code></pre>
            <p>Let's break down that command:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>--build</code>: Specifies the build command.</li>
                <li><code>--onnx</code>: The path to our input ONNX file.</li>
                <li><code>--save_engine</code>: The path for our final, optimized output file.</li>
                <li><code>--fp16</code>: Enables fast FP16 precision.</li>
                <li><code>--batch 16</code>: Optimizes the engine for a maximum batch size of 16.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After a few moments, you will have a new file: <code>resnet50_fp16.engine</code>. This file is all you need to deploy your model.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 3: Benchmark Your New Engine</h2>
            <p>How fast is it? Let's use <code>xinfer-cli</code> again to run a quick performance benchmark.</p>
            <pre><code>./xinfer-cli --benchmark \
    --engine resnet50_fp16.engine \
    --batch 16 \
    --iterations 500</code></pre>
            <p>You will see the final throughput and latency numbers for your model, running at maximum speed on your specific GPU.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>Congratulations! You have successfully built and benchmarked your first high-performance AI engine. You are now ready to use this engine in a real C++ application.</p>
            <p>Check out our <a href="/docs/quickstart.html">Quickstart Guide</a> to see how to load this engine with the <code>xInfer::zoo::ImageClassifier</code> and run inference in just a few lines of code.</p>

        <section>
            <p>For too long, C++ developers in the AI space have been treated like second-class citizens. While the Python ecosystem enjoys beautiful, high-level libraries like PyTorch and Keras, C++ developers have been stuck with low-level, boilerplate-heavy tools. Today, we are changing that.</p>
            <p>We are proud to introduce <strong>xTorch</strong>, a free, open-source C++ deep learning library designed to bring the productivity and joy of PyTorch to the native C++ world.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The "Batteries-Included" Philosophy</h2>
            <p><code>xTorch</code> is not a replacement for LibTorch; it is a powerful extension built on top of it. We provide all the high-level components that are missing from the core library:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A Powerful `Trainer` Class:</strong> Automates your training and validation loops, checkpointing, and metrics with a simple <code>.fit()</code> call.</li>
                <li><strong>A Rich `data` Module:</strong> Includes a multi-process `ExtendedDataLoader`, built-in datasets like `ImageFolder`, and a chainable `transforms` API with an OpenCV backend.</li>
                <li><strong>A `models` Zoo:</strong> A collection of standard, trainable architectures like `ResNet`, `U-Net`, and `DCGAN`, ready to use out-of-the-box.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>More Than Just an API: Performance by Default</h2>
            <p>Because `xTorch` is built in native C++, it is fundamentally more performant than its Python counterparts. Our multi-threaded data loader and efficient C++ backend eliminate the bottlenecks of Python's GIL and interpreter overhead. In our published research, a single-GPU `xTorch` system was able to train a DCGAN <strong>37% faster</strong> than a dual-GPU PyTorch system.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The On-Ramp to the Ignition Ecosystem</h2>
            <p><code>xTorch</code> is more than just a standalone library. It is the first step in our end-to-end C++ AI workflow. A model trained and saved with `xTorch` can be seamlessly ingested by our `xInfer` toolkit, providing a direct, one-click path from a training experiment to a hyper-optimized production deployment.</p>
            <p>We believe C++ developers deserve world-class tools. `xTorch` is our commitment to that vision.</p>
