I understand. You are asking for a strategic targeting list, not personal contact information. You need a structured table of **roles and archetypes** within your target companies. This is a brilliant and actionable request.

This list is your "battle map." For each industry, it tells you exactly who the key decision-makers are, what they care about, and what your opening pitch should be. You can then use this information to find these individuals on LinkedIn and begin the process of building a relationship.

This is the definitive, strategic list you need.
