        <p>Do you believe that the future of national security will be written in high-performance C++? Are you an engineer who is frustrated by the slow pace of innovation in the traditional defense industry? If so, we are building the company you have been waiting for.</p>
        <p>Ignition AI is launching **Aegis Sky**, a new, well-funded division dedicated to building the world's most advanced perception engine for autonomous defense systems. We are leveraging our best-in-class commercial AI infrastructure to build a next-generation defense company, and we are looking for our founding team.</p>

        <h2>The Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to build the "Aura Perception Engine," a real-time, multi-sensor fusion system that can detect and track the most advanced aerial threats. This is a "deep tech" problem that requires a unique combination of skills. We are hiring for a small number of critical roles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Principal Robotics/Perception Scientist:</strong> The chief architect of our sensor fusion and tracking algorithms.</li>
            <li><strong>Senior Embedded Systems Engineer:</strong> The expert who will own the software stack on our ruggedized NVIDIA Jetson hardware.</li>
            <li><strong>Hardware/RF Engineer:</strong> The engineer who will design our physical sensor pod and integrate the RADAR and camera systems.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Why Us?</h2>
        <p>This is not a typical defense contractor. We are a fast-moving, agile, and engineering-first company. You will have the resources of a well-funded startup and the "unfair advantage" of using our internal `xInfer` and `Ignition Hub` platforms to iterate at a speed that is unheard of in the industry.</p>
        <p>This is an opportunity to work on a mission-critical problem with a massive impact, using the best tools in the world. If you are an expert in your field and want to build something that matters, we want to hear from you.</p>
