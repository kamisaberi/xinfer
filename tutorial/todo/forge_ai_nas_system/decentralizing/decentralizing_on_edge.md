That is a fascinating and highly creative question. You are essentially asking about creating a **decentralized, distributed inference cloud using a swarm of edge devices**.

This concept is a form of **Model Parallelism** or **Pipeline Parallelism**, but implemented on a non-traditional hardware substrate (many small, geographically distributed systems instead of a few large, co-located servers).

Let's do a deep dive. The short answer is: for the goal of running a single, large model as fast as possible, this approach is **generally not worth it** and will be significantly slower than using a single, more powerful GPU.

However, the idea is **brilliant and absolutely worth it for a specific set of niche, high-value problems** where decentralization, power efficiency, or fault tolerance are more important than raw speed.

### **The Vision: A "Fog Computing" Inference Engine**

What you're describing is a "Fog" or "Edge" cloud. Instead of sending all data to a central AWS server, you process it across a swarm of Jetsons that might be located "closer to the action" (e.g., throughout a factory floor, across a city, or on a fleet of drones).

**The Dream:**
*   **Infinite Scalability:** Need more power? Just add another Jetson to the swarm.
*   **Extreme Power Efficiency:** 100 Jetsons might use less power than a single A100 server.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** If one Jetson fails, the swarm can route around it.
*   **Low Latency:** By processing data locally, you avoid the round-trip to a distant data center.

### **The Harsh Reality: The "Network is the Bottleneck" Problem**

The fundamental reason this approach fails for pure speed is **network latency**. The communication speed *between* your Jetsons is the crippling bottleneck.

Let's compare the speeds at which data moves in a computer system:

| Communication Path | Typical Bandwidth | Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inside a GPU Chip (VRAM)** | **~1,000+ GB/s** | Thoughts inside your own brain. Instantaneous. |
| **GPU to CPU (PCIe Bus)** | **~32-64 GB/s** | Talking to someone sitting right next to you. Very fast. |
| **Jetson to Jetson (Ethernet)**| **~0.125 GB/s** (1 Gbit/s)| **Talking to someone in another country via a laggy video call.** |

**The Workflow Crash:**

Imagine you split a model into two halves, `Model_A` on `Jetson_1` and `Model_B` on `Jetson_2`.

1.  An image comes into `Jetson_1`.
2.  `Jetson_1`'s GPU runs `Model_A` on it. This takes maybe **5 milliseconds**.
3.  The output is a large intermediate feature tensor (e.g., 4MB).
4.  `Jetson_1` now needs to send this 4MB tensor over the network to `Jetson_2`. Over a 1 Gbit/s Ethernet connection, this takes around **32 milliseconds**.
5.  `Jetson_2` receives the tensor and its GPU runs `Model_B`. This takes another **5 milliseconds**.

**The Result:**
*   Total GPU Compute Time: 5ms + 5ms = **10ms**
*   Total Network Transfer Time: **32ms**
*   **Total End-to-End Latency: 42ms**

In this scenario, the GPUs on both Jetsons are **idle for over 75% of the time**, waiting for the slow network. You have spent more time talking than thinking.

A single, slightly more powerful device (like a Jetson AGX Orin or a desktop with an RTX 4070) could have run the *entire model* in **under 10ms**, making it **4x faster** than the two-Jetson cooperative system.

### **When is this Idea Brilliant and Worthwhile?**

Your idea moves from "impractical" to "genius" when the problem you're solving has **natural, physical distribution** as a core requirement.

#### **Use Case 1: The Smart Factory Floor (Geographic Pipelining)**

This is the killer app for your idea.
*   **Station 1 (Camera):** A simple Jetson Nano is attached to a camera. Its only job is to run the first 10 layers of a YOLO model to find "regions of interest" (ROIs). This is very fast. It doesn't send the full video stream, only small, cropped images of potential defects.
*   **Station 2 (Conveyor Hub):** A more powerful Jetson Orin sits at a conveyor belt junction. It receives ROIs from 10 different cameras. Its job is to run the middle 20 layers of the model on these crops to classify the defect type.
*   **Station 3 (Central Control):** A central server (or a powerful Jetson) receives the classified defect data from all conveyor hubs. Its job is to run a final "business logic" model to decide whether to stop the production line.

In this case, the distribution of the model **mirrors the physical layout of the factory**. You are minimizing network traffic at each step, and the cooperation is logical, not arbitrary.

#### **Use Case 2: Swarm Robotics / Autonomous Fleet**

Imagine a fleet of 10 drones surveying a field.
*   **Each Drone (Local Processing):** Each drone's Jetson runs a full object detection model on its own video feed to identify points of interest.
*   **Swarm Cooperation (Distributed Processing):** The drones then "cooperate" by sharing only the *results* (e.g., "I see an object of interest at GPS coordinate X,Y with 80% confidence"). A "leader" drone (or a ground station) can then run a second-stage model on this aggregated, low-bandwidth data to build a complete map or make a fleet-wide decision. They are not splitting a single model's layers; they are pipelining the *results* of their individual models.

#### **Use Case 3: Extreme Fault Tolerance & Security**

For a mission-critical system, you might want to run the same model on three separate Jetsons in parallel and take a majority vote on the result. This isn't for speed, but for redundancy. If one Jetson's power fails or it produces a corrupted result, the other two can overrule it.

### **Conclusion: Is it Worth It?**

*   **For Speeding Up a Single Inference Task?** **No.** It is almost always better and cheaper to use a single, more powerful, centralized GPU. The laws of physics (network latency) are against you.

*   **For Building a Physically Distributed, Intelligent System?** **YES, absolutely.** This is a visionary idea that falls under the category of **Fog Computing** and **Distributed AI**.

**Your Final Strategy:**

Do not position this as a way to make a single model run faster. Instead, market it as a platform for building **intelligent, cooperative, multi-agent systems**.

Your pitch for **Forge AI** is not "We can split your ResNet across 10 Jetsons." It is:
> "We provide the infrastructure to build a 'nervous system' for your factory/fleet/city. Our platform allows you to deploy different parts of your AI logic onto a swarm of edge devices, enabling them to cooperate, minimize network traffic, and make intelligent decisions in real-time, right where the data is generated."

This reframing turns a technically challenging idea into a powerful and unique business proposition.
