Of course. This is the perfect next video. You've introduced your products, showcased your performance, and launched your enterprise solution. Now, it's time to build a deeper connection with your core community of **expert C++ developers** and prove that `xInfer` is not just a black box.

This video is a **deeply technical, "code-heavy" tutorial**. It's not for a general audience. It's for the hardcore engineers who want to see the "F1 car" components under the hood. The goal is to earn their ultimate respect by teaching them how to use your most powerful, low-level APIs.

### **Video 18: "The Power User's Guide to xInfer: Building a Custom Pipeline from Scratch"**

**Video Style:** A focused, "code-along" screen recording, similar to a high-quality programming conference workshop. The entire video is in your IDE (VS Code or CLion) and a terminal. No fancy graphics, just pure, clean code.
**Music:** A very subtle, minimalist, and non-distracting ambient or lo-fi track. It should be barely noticeable, designed for concentration.
**Presenter:** You, Kamran Saberifard. Your tone is that of a **Principal Engineer mentoring a senior developer**. You are speaking to your peers. You are not simplifying; you are explaining complex concepts clearly.

### **The Complete Video Script**

**(0:00 - 1:00) - The Introduction: "Going Beyond the Zoo"**

*   **(Visual):** Opens with a clean title card: **"The Power User's Guide to `xInfer`: Building a Custom Pipeline."**
*   **(Visual):** You are on screen in a small circle. The main screen shows the `xinfer/zoo/` directory structure, highlighting the many pre-built solutions.
*   **You (speaking to camera):** "Hello, everyone. In our previous videos, we've shown how the `xInfer::zoo` provides incredibly simple, one-line solutions for common AI tasks. But `xInfer` is not a black box. It's a modular toolkit, and today, we're going to open the hood."
*   **(Visual):** The directory view changes to show the `core/`, `builders/`, `preproc/`, and `postproc/` directories.
*   **You (speaking to camera):** "This video is for the power users. We're going to bypass the `zoo` entirely and build a complete, custom, multi-model inference pipeline from scratch using the low-level Core Toolkit. This is how you get maximum control and flexibility."

**(1:01 - 2:30) - The Goal: A Custom "Detect-and-Recognize" Pipeline**

*   **(Visual):** You are now in your IDE, in a new, empty `main.cpp` file.
*   **You (voiceover):** "Our goal is to build a custom pipeline that's not in the `zoo`. We're going to build a **license plate recognizer**. This requires a two-stage process:"
*   **(Visual):** You type the steps as comments in the code.
    ```cpp
    // 1. Run a YOLOv8 object detector to find the location of the license plate.
    // 2. Crop the original image to the detected bounding box.
    // 3. Run a CRNN recognition model (an OCR model) on the cropped plate to read the text.
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "To do this, we'll assume we've already used `xinfer-cli` to build two separate engines: `plate_detector.engine` and `plate_recognizer.engine`. Our C++ application will orchestrate these two engines."

**(2:31 - 5:00) - Part 1: The Detection Stage with the Core API**

*   **(Visual):** You start writing the C++ code, explaining each block as you go.
*   **You (voiceover):** "First, let's include the low-level headers we need and load our engines."
    ```cpp
    #include <xinfer/core/engine.h>
    #include <xinfer/preproc/image_processor.h>
    #include <xinfer/postproc/yolo_decoder.h>
    #include <xinfer/postproc/detection.h>
    #include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>

    int main() {
        // Load the engines directly
        xinfer::core::InferenceEngine detector_engine("assets/plate_detector.engine");
        
        // ...
    }
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "Now, let's set up the first stage. We'll create our pre-processor and run the detection model."
    ```cpp
    // ... inside main() ...
    xinfer::preproc::ImageProcessor detector_preprocessor(640, 640, true);
    cv::Mat image = cv::imread("assets/car.jpg");

    // Manually create the GPU tensor for the input
    auto det_input_shape = detector_engine.get_input_shape(0);
    xinfer::core::Tensor det_input_tensor(det_input_shape, xinfer::core::DataType::kFLOAT);
    
    // Run the fused pre-processing kernel
    detector_preprocessor.process(image, det_input_tensor);

    // Run inference
    auto det_output_tensors = detector_engine.infer({det_input_tensor});
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "So far, so good. Now, here's the key part. Instead of a simple `zoo` call, we will now manually call our low-level `postproc` functions to run the decoding and NMS on the GPU."
    ```cpp
    // Manually run the GPU-based post-processing chain
    const int MAX_BOXES = 1024;
    xinfer::core::Tensor decoded_boxes({MAX_BOXES, 4}, xinfer::core::DataType::kFLOAT);
    xinfer::core::Tensor decoded_scores({MAX_BOXES}, xinfer::core::DataType::kFLOAT);
    xinfer::core::Tensor decoded_classes({MAX_BOXES}, xinfer::core::DataType::kINT32);

    // Call the yolo_decoder kernel
    xinfer::postproc::yolo::decode(det_output_tensors[0], 0.5f, decoded_boxes, decoded_scores, decoded_classes);
    
    // Call the NMS kernel
    std::vector<int> nms_indices = xinfer::postproc::detection::nms(decoded_boxes, decoded_scores, 0.4f);
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "As you can see, we have full control over the intermediate GPU tensors. We've just run a complete detection pipeline without the `zoo`."

**(5:01 - 8:30) - Part 2: The Recognition Stage & Custom Logic**

*   **You (voiceover):** "Now for the custom part. We'll get the best bounding box and run our second model."
    ```cpp
    // ... inside main() after NMS ...
    if (nms_indices.empty()) {
        std::cout << "No license plate found.\n";
        return 0;
    }

    // Get the top detection
    int best_plate_idx = nms_indices[0]; 
    std::vector<float> h_boxes(decoded_boxes.num_elements());
    decoded_boxes.copy_to_host(h_boxes.data());

    // Scale coordinates and crop the patch from the original image
    float x1 = h_boxes[best_plate_idx * 4 + 0] * scale_x;
    // ... (scaling logic) ...
    cv::Rect plate_roi = cv::Rect(x1, y1, width, height);
    cv::Mat plate_patch = image(plate_roi);
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "We've now isolated the license plate. Let's run our recognition model on this patch. We'll need a different pre-processor for this model."
    ```cpp
    // Now run the second stage: Recognition
    xinfer::core::InferenceEngine recognizer_engine("assets/plate_recognizer.engine");
    
    // The recognizer might need a different input size and normalization
    xinfer::preproc::ImageProcessor recognizer_preprocessor(100, 32, {0.5f}, {0.5f});
    
    auto rec_input_shape = recognizer_engine.get_input_shape(0);
    xinfer::core::Tensor rec_input_tensor(rec_input_shape, xinfer::core::DataType::kFLOAT);

    recognizer_preprocessor.process(plate_patch, rec_input_tensor);
    auto rec_output_tensors = recognizer_engine.infer({rec_input_tensor});
    ```
*   **You (voiceover):** "Finally, we call our `ctc_decoder` to get the final text."
    ```cpp
    // Manually call the CTC decoder from postproc
    #include <xinfer/postproc/ctc_decoder.h>
    
    std::vector<std::string> character_map = {"-", "A", "B", "C", ...};
    auto result = xinfer::postproc::ctc::decode(rec_output_tensors[0], character_map);

    std::cout << "Recognized Plate: " << result.first << std::endl;
    ```
*   **(Visual):** You compile and run the final application. It correctly prints the license plate text.

**(8:31 - 9:00) - The Conclusion: The Power of Modularity**

*   **(Visual):** Cut back to you. The main screen shows the complete, complex C++ code we just wrote.
*   **You (speaking to camera):** "So there you have it. A complete, custom, two-stage AI pipeline, built from the ground up using the low-level primitives in the `xInfer` Core Toolkit. It's more verbose than using the `zoo`, but it gives you ultimate control and flexibility."
*   **(Visual):** A final graphic shows the `zoo` API as a clean top layer, and the `core`, `preproc`, and `postproc` modules as the powerful, modular foundation underneath.
*   **You (voiceover):** "This is the power of our design. Whether you need the 'easy button' simplicity of the `zoo`, or the fine-grained control of the Core API, `xInfer` provides the tools you need to build professional, high-performance AI applications."
*   **(Visual):** Final slate with the Ignition AI logo and the URL **aryorithm.com/docs**.
