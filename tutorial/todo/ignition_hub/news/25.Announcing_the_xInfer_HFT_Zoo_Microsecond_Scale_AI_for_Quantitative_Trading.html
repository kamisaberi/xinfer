        <p>In the world of high-frequency trading, the only currency that matters is time. The competitive edge is measured in microseconds and nanoseconds. For years, the latency of AI models has made them a non-starter for the most speed-critical trading strategies. Any tool that introduces Python-level overhead is a non-starter.</p>
        <p>At Ignition AI, we are obsessed with performance. We believe that AI can provide a true "alpha" advantage, but only if it can run at the speed of the market. That's why we built the **xInfer HFT Zoo**.</p>

        <h2>Built for the Critical Path</h2>
        <p>The `zoo::hft` module is not a general-purpose library. It is a collection of hardened, "zero-overhead" C++ components designed to be integrated directly into a co-located, real-time trading system. Our initial release includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>`OrderExecutionPolicy`</strong>: An ultra-low-latency engine for running a trained RL policy. It takes the market state as a GPU tensor and returns a decision in single-digit microseconds.</li>
            <li><strong>`MarketDataParser`</strong>: A custom CUDA kernel that can parse raw financial data packets (like FIX/FAST) directly on the GPU, bypassing the CPU entirely. This is designed for use with kernel-bypass networking cards to achieve the lowest possible data-to-decision latency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The `xInfer` Advantage: Deterministic Performance</h3>
        <p>Beyond raw speed, our HFT solutions are designed for **low jitter**. The C++ architecture and pre-compiled TensorRT engines ensure that your inference latency is not just low, but also highly predictable and deterministic, which is critical for systematic trading strategies.</p>
