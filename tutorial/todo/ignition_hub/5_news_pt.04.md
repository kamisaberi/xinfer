            <p class="subtitle">A look under the hood at the cloud-native build farm that powers our on-demand TensorRT engine service.</p>
            <p class="meta">Published: February 1, 2026 | By: The Ignition AI Engineering Team</p>
        </header>

        <section>
            <p>The "magic" of the Ignition Hub—the ability to get a perfectly optimized TensorRT engine for any model on any hardware with a single command—is the result of a sophisticated, scalable, and fully automated cloud backend. In this post, we want to give you a look at the architecture that makes this possible.</p>
            
            <p>Our core challenge was to solve the "build matrix from hell": hundreds of popular models multiplied by dozens of GPU architectures, TensorRT versions, and precision configurations. The solution is a distributed, container-based build farm.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Core Components</h2>
            <figure>
                <!-- A diagram showing: User -> API -> Queue -> Builder Agent -> Cache -> User -->
                <img src="assets/hub_architecture_diagram.png" alt="Architecture diagram of the Ignition Hub">
                <figcaption>The high-level architecture of the Ignition Hub build pipeline.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>1. The API & Web Frontend</h3>
            <p>This is the entry point. It's a standard web service that handles user authentication, model uploads (for enterprise), and build requests. When a user requests an engine, the API first checks our cache (e.g., an S3 bucket). If a pre-built engine exists, it's served instantly.</p>

            <h3>2. The Job Queue</h3>
            <p>If a requested engine is not in the cache, the API places a new "build job" onto a robust message queue (like RabbitMQ or AWS SQS). This job contains all the necessary metadata: the model's location, the target GPU architecture (e.g., `sm_87`), the TensorRT version, and the desired precision.</p>

            <h3>3. The Auto-Scaling Build Farm</h3>
            <p>This is the heart of the system. It's a Kubernetes cluster with multiple node groups, each configured with a different class of NVIDIA GPU (T4, A100, H100, RTX 4090, etc.). A "builder agent" (a specialized Docker container) is running on these nodes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The agent pulls a job from the queue.</li>
                <li>It downloads the source model.</li>
                <li>It invokes our internal `xinfer::builders` toolkit to run the time-consuming TensorRT build process.</li>
                <li>It runs a quick validation test on the generated engine.</li>
                <li>Upon success, it uploads the final `.engine` file to our central cache and notifies the user.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion: An "F1 Factory" in the Cloud</h2>
            <p>By building this automated, cloud-native factory, we have productized the complex and time-consuming task of performance optimization. It allows us to provide the entire AI community with perfectly tuned "F1 car" engines on demand, a core part of our mission to accelerate the future of AI deployment.</p>

            <p>The <code>xInfer::zoo</code> provides incredible, one-line solutions for common tasks. But what if your problem is unique? What if you need to chain multiple models together or implement custom logic between steps? For this, you need the <strong>xInfer Core Toolkit</strong>.</p>
            <p>This guide will show you how to use the low-level components—<code>core::InferenceEngine</code>, <code>preproc::ImageProcessor</code>, and <code>postproc::detection</code>—to build a custom, two-stage pipeline from scratch.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Goal: "Find the Largest Cat and Classify It"</h2>
            <p>Our custom pipeline will:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Run a YOLOv8 object detector to find all objects in a scene.</li>
                <li>Implement custom C++ logic to find the bounding box of the largest "cat".</li>
                <li>Crop the image to that bounding box.</li>
                <li>Run a ResNet-50 classifier on the cropped patch to determine the cat's breed.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>The Code</h3>
            <pre><code>#include &lt;xinfer/core/engine.h&gt;
#include &lt;xinfer/preproc/image_processor.h&gt;
#include &lt;xinfer/postproc/detection.h&gt;
#include &lt;xinfer/postproc/yolo_decoder.h&gt;
#include &lt;opencv2/opencv.hpp&gt;

int main() {
    // 1. Load both of your pre-built engines
    xinfer::core::InferenceEngine detector_engine("yolov8.engine");
    xinfer::core::InferenceEngine classifier_engine("resnet50.engine");

    // 2. Set up a pre-processor for the detector
    xinfer::preproc::ImageProcessor detector_preprocessor(640, 640, true);

    // 3. Run the detection stage
    cv::Mat image = cv::imread("living_room.jpg");
    xinfer::core::Tensor det_input;
    detector_preprocessor.process(image, det_input);
    auto det_outputs = detector_engine.infer({det_input});
    
    // ... Post-process detection outputs to get a vector of BoundingBox ...
    // (This part uses yolo_decoder and nms)

    // 4. Custom Logic: Find the largest cat
    cv::Rect largest_cat_box;
    float max_area = 0;
    for (const auto& box : detections) {
        if (box.label == "cat") {
            float area = (box.x2 - box.x1) * (box.y2 - box.y1);
            if (area > max_area) {
                max_area = area;
                largest_cat_box = cv::Rect(box.x1, box.y1, box.x2-box.x1, box.y2-y1);
            }
        }
    }

    // 5. Run the classification stage on the cropped patch
    if (max_area > 0) {
        cv::Mat cat_patch = image(largest_cat_box);
        
        xinfer::preproc::ImageProcessor classifier_preprocessor(224, 224, mean, std);
        xinfer::core::Tensor cls_input;
        classifier_preprocessor.process(cat_patch, cls_input);
        
        auto cls_outputs = classifier_engine.infer({cls_input});
        // ... Post-process classification output ...
    }
}
            </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion: Power and Flexibility</h2>
            <p>This example shows the true power of the `xInfer` design. The `zoo` provides the "easy button," but the Core Toolkit provides the unconstrained flexibility and control that expert developers demand. By composing these high-performance, low-level primitives, you can build any custom AI pipeline imaginable.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Introducing our new suite of hyper-optimized pipelines for sentiment analysis, text embeddings, and more, built for native C++ applications.</p>
            <p class="meta">Published: February 28, 2026 | By: The Ignition AI Team</p>

        <section>
            <p>At Ignition AI, our mission is to deliver the fastest possible performance for all AI workloads. While our initial focus has been on computer vision, we are thrilled to announce a major expansion of our platform: the **xInfer NLP Zoo**.</p>
            <p>C++ applications in finance, gaming, and server-side processing often need to handle a massive throughput of text data. The latency and overhead of calling a Python microservice for tasks like sentiment analysis or semantic search is a major bottleneck. The `xInfer NLP Zoo` solves this by bringing state-of-the-art Transformer models directly into your C++ application, running at maximum speed.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What's Included in the NLP Zoo v1.0</h2>
            <p>Our initial release provides easy-to-use, high-performance pipelines for the most critical NLP tasks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>`zoo::nlp::Classifier`</strong>: For high-throughput sentiment or intent classification.</li>
                <li><strong>`zoo::nlp::Embedder`</strong>: The backbone of semantic search and RAG. Generate sentence embeddings with state-of-the-art models like Sentence-BERT at incredible speed.</li>
                <li><strong>`zoo::nlp::NER`</strong>: For extracting named entities from text.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example: High-Performance Semantic Search</h3>
            <p>With the new `Embedder`, you can build a semantic search engine that is orders of magnitude faster than Python-based solutions.</p>
            <pre><code>#include &lt;xinfer/zoo/nlp/embedder.h&gt;

int main() {
    // 1. Initialize the embedder with a pre-built Sentence-BERT engine
    xinfer::zoo::nlp::EmbedderConfig config;
    config.engine_path = "all-mpnet-base-v2.engine";
    xinfer::zoo::nlp::Embedder embedder(config);

    // 2. Create embeddings for your document database (this is done once)
    std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; documents = {"doc1.txt", "doc2.txt", ...};
    auto document_embeddings = embedder.predict_batch(documents);

    // 3. At query time, embed the query and find the most similar document
    std::string query = "What is the capital of France?";
    auto query_embedding = embedder.predict(query);

    // ... (fast vector similarity search logic) ...
}
            </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Future is Multi-Modal</h2>
            <p>This is just the beginning. The NLP Zoo is a core part of our strategy to make `xInfer` the definitive performance platform for all AI domains. Stay tuned for our upcoming releases, which will include pipelines for summarization, question answering, and high-throughput LLM inference.</p>

        <section>
            <p>The first wave of the AI revolution was defined by the cloud. Massive data centers with thousands of GPUs were necessary to train the large models that power applications like ChatGPT and Midjourney. But this is just the beginning of the story.</p>
            <p>The next, and arguably more profound, wave of AI will not happen in a distant data center. It will happen right here, in the physical world. It will run on the drones that inspect our infrastructure, the robots in our factories, the medical devices in our hospitals, and the cars on our roads.</p>
            <p>This is the world of **Edge AI**, and it is a world that runs on a different set of rules.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Three Laws of the Edge</h2>
            <p>Unlike the cloud, the edge is constrained by physics. Three factors are paramount:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Latency is Law:</strong> For a self-driving car or a surgical robot, the speed of light is a real constraint. You cannot afford a round-trip to the cloud to make a decision. The computation must happen locally, in milliseconds.</li>
                <li><strong>Power is Everything:</strong> Edge devices run on batteries. Every watt of power consumed by the AI chip reduces the drone's flight time or the wearable's battery life. Performance-per-watt is the single most important metric.</li>
                <li><strong>Connectivity is a Myth:</strong> A factory robot, a remote sensor, or a military system cannot assume it will have a stable internet connection. The AI must be fully autonomous and capable of operating offline.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why This Demands a New Stack</h2>
            <p>The slow, power-hungry, and cloud-dependent Python-based software stack that dominates AI research is fundamentally unsuited for this new reality. The future of Edge AI will be built on a foundation of high-performance, efficient, and reliable C++ systems.</p>
            <p>This is the core thesis behind Ignition AI. We are building the tools—<code>xTorch</code>, <code>xInfer</code>, and the <code>Ignition Hub</code>—that will empower the next generation of engineers to build this intelligent edge. Our obsession with performance, our focus on the C++ ecosystem, and our expertise in low-level GPU optimization are all in service of this single vision.</p>
            <p>The companies that win the next decade of AI will not be the ones with the biggest models in the cloud. They will be the ones who can deploy the smartest, most efficient intelligence into the physical world. That is the future we are building.</p>
